I'll make this quick(ish) since Lil Nas X's new music video for "MONTERO (Call Me By Your Name" is all over the socials at the moment. Sparknotes version: he descends a stripper pole into hell, red braids swirling around him, to shake ass in the devil's face while wearing thigh-high leather boots and what I call ball-huggers (brief-style men's underwear). I'd suggest watching it for yourself; there's a lot going on, and it's all incredible. 

Predictably, the self-appointed gatekeepers of all that is holy and American fired up the faux outrage machine. Nothing new from the right; use Christianity as a weapon to be racist/homophobic under the guise of "protecting our children" and "restoring traditional American values." That's all it really is, and there are topics far more meaningful and people far more qualified to speak on all that than me. But I can smell this percolating and wanted to take some time to hate on two of the haters. 

The appetizer here is Kristi Noem, the brain-dead, gun-toting governor of South Dakota. Before taking Monday afternoon to tout her participation in a discriminatory executive order barring transgender women from participating in K-12 sports (under the guise of fairness, of course), one of her interns showed her a picture of the shoes Lil Nas X released along with the song and video.
