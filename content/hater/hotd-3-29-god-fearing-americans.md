I'll make this quick(ish) since Lil Nas X's new music video for "MONTERO (Call Me By Your Name)" is all over the socials at the moment. Sparknotes version: he descends a stripper pole into hell, red braids swirling around him, to shake ass in the devil's face while wearing thigh-high leather boots and what I call ball-huggers (brief-style men's underwear). I'd suggest watching it for yourself; there's a lot going on, and it's all very entertaining.

Predictably, the self-appointed gatekeepers of all that is holy and American fired up the faux outrage machine. Nothing new from the right; use Christianity as a weapon to be racist/homophobic under the guise of "protecting our children" and "restoring traditional American values." That's a separate can of worms I won't open right now, but as is custom in this section, I wanted to take some time to hate on two of the haters.

The appetizer here is Kristi Noem, the brain-dead, gun-toting governor of South Dakota. Before spending the rest of the week [cooking up an executive order](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/30/politics/south-dakota-transgender-sports-kristi-noem/index.html) barring transgender athletes from participating in K-12 girls sports (in other words, trans women aren't women in South Dakota), she spent the Lord's Day #owning the libs. Unable to help herself or find something to do beyond being a discriminatory, narrow-minded sack of sh*t, she fired off this snappy little number.

First of all, Kristi, these are fire. I've always loved 97s. Second of all, God-given eternal soul? I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but if we're talking souls, [yours is not in the greatest of shape](https://www.thedailybeast.com/gov-kristi-noem-says-shes-celebrating-intl-womens-day-by-signing-anti-trans-bill). Just type "Kristi Noem scandal" into Google for more (mostly [misusing taxpayer dollars](https://prospect.org/power/noem-bill-would-make-dark-money-disclosure-illegal/), [giving a raise to her daughter](https://www.aberdeennews.com/news/opinion/from-about-41k-to-58k-for-governor-s-daughter/article_fc637b86-1dbc-11ea-b961-db14b62c3554.html) while bemoaning budget issues and [bullying high schoolers](https://dakotafreepress.com/2019/06/16/girls-stater-expelled-after-posting-photo-of-noem-and-anti-trump-message/)). Funny, I'm seeing lots of money-related transgressions in there–what was it the Bible said about the rich man getting into Heaven? If this is what "fight hard, fight smart" looks like, I think the rest of us are gonna be just fine.

But the real treat is poopy pants gun girl. I don't know how to spell her name (Caytlin? Kaytlyn? Kaiytliyn?), but I like PPGG as an acronym. Anyway, she hit a triple word score in her responses–racism, homophobia (tweeting "At least I can procreate") and Karen victimhood. She's saying the quiet parts out loud again! All Lil Nas X did was call her shitty pants, and PPGG, like the good Karen she is, jumped off the porch with racism. And for funzies, she claimed Lil Nas X [threatened to rape her father](https://twitter.com/kaitmarieox/status/1376375609555886080). As you can probably deduce for yourself, that's not quite what he said.

Are people really this dumb? I know they are, but we've been having this conversation since before I was born. MUSIC is ART, it is a medium for SELF EXPRESSION. Lil Nas X is an artist who has made it abundantly clear he can, and will, do whatever he damn well pleases. Children will consume art, music especially, and connect with whatever resonates with them. Also, FWIW, Lil Nas X snaps the devil's neck at the end of the video–he defeated Satan by distracting him with ass. Kristi and PPGG aren't with killing the devil? The soul of this nation may truly be unsafe.

It's a rollout, folks; bad press is still good press, and this isn't even bad press–the video is dope. None of the outraged parties would've known about or given a second thought to this song, video, the shoes, etc. if their sh*tty little interns hadn't tucked it away for faux-outrage Monday. Yes, it's just one of the countless side effects of morally bankrupt, substance-devoid American politics, but this is _decades_ old. We did this dance with jazz, then rock, then metal, then hip-hop. WE DID IT TWO MONTHS AGO WITH "WAP." Meanwhile, we've had three mass shootings in three weeks, are a couple months removed from a deadly armed insurrection incited and carried out by white Americans, are approaching a fourth COVID wave that put the death toll above 600k and the AAPI community can't go outside without fear of being attacked. But remember everyone, the "Old Town Road" guy face-f*cking the devil will be the end of us all. And you're all going to hell.

Lil Nas X walks the line well between trolling and making a point, and I think he's done both here. I'd imagine people have been telling LNX he's going to hell ever since he came out (or even before). To me, he flipped that on its head and went to hell, shall we say, on his terms. He described this song as [a love letter to his younger self](https://www.instagram.com/p/CM3i2RelCkK/), so that all seems to check out. At the same time, he also said something along the lines of, "You can't win, I've thought about this rollout for too long." LNX came up on Twitter; he's punching down to most of these clueless, humorless, soulless asswipes. His responses are _extremely_ benign compared to what's being said about him. But you need attention to capitalize on your talent these days, and LNX is doing just that. Stir sh*t, ask questions later seems to be his M.O., and if you don't like it, tough toodles.

The beautiful bit about microwave news cycles is that this won't be a story next week. The right will have moved on to something equally banal and unproductive, and the left will do the same. But stop doing this to music–nobody's making anybody listen to anything. Political music can be great and add a lot to larger conversations, but this is a pop song with some wild visuals. Lo and behold, he's not even the first musician to use Satanic imagery. Let artists create what they want, let people enjoy what resonates with them and, to borrow a talking point from the GOP, mind your business.
