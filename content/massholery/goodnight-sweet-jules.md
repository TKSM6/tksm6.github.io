+++
The top story out of Foxborough last week was Julian Edelman's retirement, and I am sad. Not for him–his knee is shot, he made his money and I'd suspect he's got a bright life after football waiting for him in front of whatever camera he chooses. We saw the wheels falling off a bit last season; anytime an older player attempts, and then aborts, a comeback from a tough injury, there's probably a reason why. But doling out flowers to those who deserve them is never a bad idea, and I'd like to do so for Jules.

As a fan, I first knew Edelman as knockoff Wes Welker, then the other guy [who grew his hair out](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/151433606194509219/) with Brady during that glorious era. At that point, he was a (quality) special teamer and supplementary slot receiver that I didn't expect to stick around long (despite [a strong rookie campaign](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/E/EdelJu00.htm#:\~:text=Draft%3A%20New%20England%20Patriots%20in,of%20the%202009%20NFL%20Draft.) in '09) given the Patriots' penchant for burning through players at that position. Fast forward to 2011, and the already-shaky secondary was losing guys to injury at an alarming pace. All the sudden, there was a white dude playing slot corner. Of course, it was Jules. He went on to play offense, defense and special teams for the Pats in that second Super Bowl we don't talk about.

At first, Edelman's best ability was availability. Once Welker hit the bricks and the Pats brought in Danny Amendola to replace him, Edelman shopped around, wound up taking the one year prove-it deal and blossomed. The Patriots DO NOT WIN Super Bowls 4, 5 and 6 without him. Edelman was better than Amendola and allowed the Pats to expand on the Welker role. McDaniels could build out that route tree to suit New Wes, and as he aged, Brady retained a trusty safety valve to help him get rid of the ball quickly and pick up all-important 6-9 yard-chunks down the middle in years where offensive line and outside receiver depth was thin. That became even more important after Aaron Hernandez, yknow, and Gronk's body began breaking down. He was the perfect slot receiver; shifty, fast and tough with a nose for space and a silky pair of hands. The man relished contact, a crucial trait for someone who was smeared more thoroughly and frequently than bugs on windshields.

Statistically, Edelman's isn't the most eye-popping Pro Football Reference page out there, but there are some interesting tidbits. The big one is the 2nd-most postseason receiving yards of all time with 1,442 (as well as a Super Bowl MVP trophy). Looking beyond that, his yards per reception percentage was above 10 in all but two of his 11 season–his rookie year, and a 2011 season where he only had six total receptions. From 2013-2019, he averaged over six receptions per game, only dipping below 50 receiving first downs in a season once across that same stretch. Like many Belichick finds, [he was a special teams ace](https://youtu.be/N4bJiXjdKVs?t=164)–especially as a returner (2nd amongst active players in punt return TDs and yards per punt return at the time of his retirement). All that said, my favorite Edelman stats are from those playoff runs in 2014, 2016 and 2018. Final combined tally from those nine games: 1,011 yards on 73 receptions, 54 first downs, two TDs (though he also threw a passing TD in '14) and 112.3 yards per game. As Giselle famously told us, her husband cannot throw and catch the ball, so Tom's bromance with Edelman existed for good reason. And then there was this catch.

You could pick plenty of huge moments from that Super Bowl and make a compelling case for it being the tipping point, but emotionally, I submit this as _the_ one. Belichick said this after the game, but the Patriots had been on the other side of that specific equation in each of their three most recent SB appearances (Tyree, Manningham, Kearse). But this time, it was their emotional leader making the huge play. For Edelman to somehow come up with that ball, on the readjustment, bum pinky finger to boot, is something I can only chalk up to the nebulous concept of football karma. In a way, it brought [Welker's SB drop from 2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT6XziIQ5RI) full circle. Four years after the original drop, one that would've probably clinched the game and was bungled by a man with some of the surest hands these eyes have seen, his "replacement" got his hands under a ball he never should've caught to keep a comeback that never should've happened alive.

Along those same lines, how do we define Edelman's career? Let's get one thing out of the way first–no, he is not a Hall of Famer. Pats HoF and a red jacket? Absolutely, but no gold and no Canton bust. Look at this year's [Modern Era Finalists](https://www.profootballhof.com/15-modern-era-player-finalists-announced-for-hofs-class-of-2021/) at wide receiver–it's Calvin Johnson, Roddy White and Reggie Wayne. For all his greatness, Edelman is a solid two or three tiers below that bar. You'd be hard pressed to make the case for him over guys like Hines Ward, Andre Johnson, even Ochocinco. Wes Welker himself also has a stronger statistical case for the HoF. The ["similar players"](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/E/EdelJu00.htm) chart is another fun Pro Football Reference tool, and the most similar career to Edelman's from the 21st century would be that of one T.J. Houshmandzadeh. That seems about right to me–T.J. was another great player and a menace for AFC teams to deal with, but not an HoFer.

But all that shouldn't, and probably doesn't, matter to Pats fans. Edelman is one of several key supporting characters from the Brady-Belichick area that will be fondly remembered locally (with the charisma and nose for attention that makes it very unlikely he will allow you to forget him). I always enjoy drawing parallels between Boston athletes playing different sports, and the guy that immediately comes to mind for Edelman is Dustin Pedroia. Both were the "heart-and-soul" emotional leaders of their respective teams; never the hands-down most talented player, but always the guy making the key play in the middle of the field, with extra effort, to win. Both got three rings and both had to retire before they were ready with injuries.

So Jules, thanks for the mems, the slants, the first downs and all the rest. I'll definitely miss him zipping around the middle, settling into softs spots, eating hits from 250-pounders and delivering death-by-a-thousand-cuts to teams from coast to coast. It's a shame he couldn't go out on his own terms, but other than that, he left no box unchecked. He was the ultimate overachiever in all the best ways, and he'll always be well-remembered and well-loved in New England.
