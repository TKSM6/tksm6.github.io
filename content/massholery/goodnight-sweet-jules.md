The top story out of Foxborough this week is Julian Edelman's retirement, and I am sad. Not for himâ€“his knee is shot, he made his money and I'd suspect he's got a bright life after football waiting for him in front of whatever camera he chooses.  We saw the wheels falling off a bit last season; anytime an older player attempts and then aborts a comeback from injury, there's probably a reason why. But doling out flowers to those who deserve them is never a bad idea, and I'd like to do so for Jules. 

As a fan, I first knew Edelman as knockoff Wes Welker, then the other guy who grew his hair out with Brady during that glorious era. At that point, he was a special teamer and supplementary slot receiver I didn't expect to stick around given the Patriots' penchant for burning through receivers. All the sudden, there was a white guy in the secondary. Of course, it was Jules. 

At first, Edelman's best ability was availability. Once Welker got jettisoned, he blossomed. The Patriots DO NOT WIN Super Bowls 4, 5 and 6 without him. Edelman allowed the Pats to expand on the Welker role; McDaniels could build out that route tree to suit Wes 2.0, and Brady retained that trusty safety valve to get rid of the ball quickly and pick up the all-important 6-9 yards in years where offensive line and outside receiver depth was thin. That became even more important after Aaron Hernandez, yknow, and Gronk began missing more and more time. He was the perfect slot receiver; shifty and tough with a nose for space and a silky pair of hands. The man relished contact, a crucial trait for someone who was smeared more thoroughly than a bug on a windshield.
