title = "Baseball Cards are Survivors"

+++
Baseball cards are one of the few “relics” that remain popular, both with nostalgics, a bit with modern kids and now, via a leap online, NFTs (I’m not talking about those because I don’t know enough). There aren’t many others; bikes and skateboards come to mind, dolls and dollhouses too, I'm sure there are more. But even I, someone who mostly grew up in the 21st century, feel like an old man when thinking about what kids are raised on today. I never had video games (because of my parents), wasn’t really on the internet until middle school and walked around with a flip phone in my pocket until high school. My sister, three years younger, had a smartphone by the time she got to 9th grade.

The fact that the baseball card, and the sports card in general, made it to my generation is a minor miracle. Baseball has been badly outstripped by football and basketball in the minds, lives and feeds of American kids. I can’t speak much on modern children considering I have none, but I imagine sports cards don’t quite match up to Candy Crush or an Xbox. And yet, they survive. I can appreciate its timeless appeal for a kid that loves sports with the cool pictures, stats, collector’s appeal. But you can’t play games on it.

I remember the first pack of cards I got. It was an old box set of 100+ from the late 80s/early 90s made of the flimsy, papery material that was the norm back then. My dad picked them up from Ocean State Job Lot. For those unfamiliar, the Lot is basically a Walmart with weirder, cheaper stuff. Finding a box of 25-year-old baseball cards is par for the course. I’d say they couldn’t have cost more than $10.

At that point, I was eight or nine years old and a full-blown Red Sox fan following their curse–busting World Series win in ’04. Of course, I had no idea who any of the players in the old set were. I recognized Tony Gwynn, but only because [his son was playing in the MLB](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/name-drop-san-diego/story/2020-07-21/tony-gwynn-jr-name-drop-san-diego-podcast) by that point. But my love for cards arose from something else.

Not long after I got that first set, one of my parents came home with a binder. Inside the binder were plastic pages with 12 little sleeves on them. Far from a child prodigy, I was confused about their purpose. They were for the cards and, newly enlightened, I set about organizing. I found countless ways to sort and order the cards; by team, color, position, last name and more. As I expanded my collection beyond baseball, I got more binders. Still, they were all dwarfed by the mammoth two-incher stuffed to the brim with random baseball players.

By then, I had advanced to current players. At the time (roughly ’05-’08), Topps were the easiest to find, so that’s what I bought. There were two card stores I frequented, both of which went under by 2010. They were little holes-in-the-wall, one on Main Street in Melrose and the other at the top of the Neck in Fairhaven. They were remarkably similar in layout and merchandise; long, narrow rooms filled with sports memorabilia and other relevant odds and ends. I would beg my dad to take me in each time we drove by, and he often would. A pack of cards was cheap (maybe $7), so the collection grew quickly.

I would spend hours on the floor sorting. Each time a new pack or set arrived, all the cards had to come out. I would create little piles on the living room carpet based on that day’s organizational technique. It was a good activity for muggy summer days when going outside meant heatstroke wasn’t far off. It would take hours, but I was totally engrossed. Occasionally, I found trade partners (like real baseball!). I’d take a stack of players on the block over to friend’s houses and start dealing. I’d like to think I made some shrewd moves in my day.

After amassing a sizable collection, I decided to figure out what it was worth. Being a child and knowing nothing about card collecting or sales, I assumed quantity equated to value. I received a card index from a relative for my birthday and set about totaling up my collection. As I soon realized, most of the cards I owned were worth a whopping…10 cents. The most valuable one I had was a Nomar (Nomahhhhhh) Cubs card that had a piece of his bat embedded. That went for a tasty…five dollars. All told, the collection was basically worthless. They’re still in my childhood bedroom.

Come to think of it, collecting baseball cards taught me a lot about organizing. As I progressed through school, I found I was much more put together than my peers when it came to tasks such as not losing homework. Can a direct line be drawn? Probably not, but it didn’t hurt. I’m sure kids everywhere could tell stories about the weird stuff they loved back in the day that somehow helped them down the road, and mine was baseball cards. And despite technology, despite the state of baseball, I reckon they’ll stick around a bit longer.
