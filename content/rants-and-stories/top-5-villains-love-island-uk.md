Ohhhhhh BABY I’ve been waiting for this one. I’ve been kicking a list around in my head for quite some time, but it’s time to make it official. I’ll be leaving out the U.S. versions since I didn’t watch all of it and what I saw disgusted me. I know people like that; it hits too close to home. The Aussies were generally too chill to achieve peak villainy [but still had their moments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApMwvtT1plw). But those damned Brits, stuck on their rainy little island, unsurprisingly dredged up some horrible people over six series.

It’s important to note seasons 1 and 2 were in another league when it comes to toxicity. This was before the show really hit it big and producers let more fly, such as on-camera sex, unlimited drinks, cartons of cigs, etc. From season 3 on, it mostly turned into an influencer convention with less MA-rated content, smoking and drinking. It also became more tame–and rightfully so–as former islanders spoke out on how their mental health suffered in that environment. There's been a lot [written and said](https://www.theringer.com/tv/2019/7/8/20682978/love-island-reality-tv-mental-health) about how lacking Love Island is with their post-show mental health care, so while this list is all in good fun, it's important to acknowledge when people who've shown more of themselves on international TV than 99.9% of us ever will (comes with the territory, granted) are not being properly cared for after the fact.

What does it take to become a villain on a show like this? For me, it comes down to a couple things. Emotional immaturity almost always plays a factor. Liars are the worst. Cockiness and insecurity often lead to shadiness. Stupidity always works against these people. But the manipulators are the worst–the ones who gaslight, emotionally bankrupt their partners, play mind games and are ruthlessly self-centered. So without any further ado, let’s go.

**Honorable Mentions**

**Eden (Australia Season 1):** This short-tempered, emotionally stunted prison guard stuck with his partner Erin from day 1 and eventually finished second. Along the way, he shouted down Tayla, tried to fight a smaller man, pissed and moaned constantly and was generally a brat. He and Erin split after [she said the relationship became abusive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ClNdVzRaJk); he denies it, but where there's this sort of smoke, there's usually fire. Eden claims Erin painted him as an “aggressive, angry, threatening person” and that he isn’t really that guy. I’d like to let Eden know that’s exactly how he came across on the show.

**Javi (Season 2):** I’m sure he’d be on the real list had he stuck around any longer, but this desperate little worm was first man voted off that season. I actually liked how, at first, he would get in the confessional and speak his mind, but then there’s the matter of what was on his mind. He was, hands-down, one of the most toxic dudes on the show.

**Naomi (Season 1):** An ice queen in the classic sense, Naomi wrapped her younger partner Josh (a full-blown douche in his own right) so tightly around her finger it killed what few brain cells he had left. He stood no chance, but Naomi got greedy, got caught in a few lies and fans and islanders alike turned on her. All she really did was go after other girls’ guys, lead Josh on and lie (small potatoes in the villa), but because she did it with her nose in the air, it rubbed everyone the wrong way.

_*It's damn near impossible to find any video of her, or any real video from Season 1._

**Eyal (Season 4):** This guy was less of a villain and more an insufferable, pseudo-spiritual douche. He’s the guy that went to a couple therapy sessions and figured out how to sound emotionally mature while still behaving like a middle schooler. Lucky for him, he got mad at the nicest dude on the show (Dr. Alex) for going after a girl he was interested in after Eyal…did that exact thing to Alex days before. He showed his true colors–insecure, mostly–the second he got pressed and was gone not longer after. He also acted like a weirdo the whole time.

5. **Georgia-** I think Georgia was 20 when she showed up on the island, and you could tell. It wasn’t even original–there was a nastier, crazier version of Georgia (the next entrant on this list) on a previous season. She was smart enough to know how to get what she wanted, but too petulant to know how to act when she didn’t. Her [#1 catchphrase was loyalty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLqdd16b7vw), and her M.O. was treating everyone like crap. It was a classic example of demanding what you don’t offer in return. She threw fits, popped off at people, couldn’t handle a drink and instigated, but she found her man in Sam. She convinced him to leave the villa with her so she could…cheat on him with her ex and then [lie/gaslight Sam about it](https://www.youtube.com/embed/TyFQ9Y5d1WE?start=480) during the Christmas reunion. She also [kissed a guy on a date](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9DVIWiZ0oU) while still in the villa before flat-out lying about it in front of everyone. She stuck around long enough to make a serious impression and have an argument with nearly everyone, so she makes the cut over the other HMs.

4. **Kady (Season 2)-** The original Georgia from season 2, Kady was also a liar, but her brand was emotional manipulation. Like Georgia, Kady was 20 when she showed up on the show and took a shine to an older man (in this case Scott). Though he was far from faultless in their constant fighting, Kady provoked most of it. She played his insecurities to her advantage and then swooped in to keep stringing him along before Scott could cobble together enough brain cells to realize she was making him happy AND miserable (or decide to leave her). She LOVED to argue and [pick fights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s-mCc7hcyA)–mostly with Scott, but [anyone could catch those hands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmOIKp55Go). The defining moment was her having a full-blown meltdown when a new girl came in and invited Scott out on a date, as is often custom. Nothing happened, but she called the girl some nasty names and told Scott what he could go do with himself (mind you, bro had no say in any of this). Meanwhile, Kady had done a bit of flirting, dating and rubbernecking of her own while still “with” Scott. It's one of the most crystal-clear example of unabashed hypocrisy on a show full of hypocrites, and Kady is probably the reason they continue casting 20/21-year-olds–they stir the pot.

3. & 2. **The Alberti Twins (Season 1)-** [These guys were just huge tools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gB_7gsohWo), not much else too it. They were too stupid to lie their way in, and they had two cracks at it. All the while, the twins were talking prodigious amounts of sh*t about how they were “real men” with money and the whole situation were beneath them. They were extremely rude to all the women and had excuses galore for all of it. Facially, they were some of the ugliest dudes that have ever been on the show, pulled up in matching suits like the herbs they were and called themselves the Italian Stallions despite being painfully British. They were unwatchable; I have no idea why they came back for a second round of dinner dates at the end when it was clear everyone already hated them. I guess they needed huge villains for season 1 and found them, but seriously, there was not a single redeemable moment or quality for either of them.

_*There isn't much video on YouTube to help me illustrate my point, but I'm not wrong. Go look on Reddit if you really care._

1\. **Jonny (Season 3)-** A literal man baby, but the kind that’s lived enough life to think they have all the answers. Jonny wormed his way in with Camila (the humanitarian ordinance disposal worker who [deserved so much better than this show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3scaU7ZHyXY)) by playing up how cultured he was. For him, that mostly just meant he got a lot of money and used it as an excuse to be a prick. Camila figured it out pretty early and took a step back after Jonny offered a detailed explanation on why he doesn’t believe in feminism (after she correctly defined it for him) or think work conditions were unfair for women today. But his masterpiece was how he perfectly he proved her right after the fact. Jonny ended up hitting the destruct button on him and Camila instead of trying to learn, listen, be better, etc. He did so because [a younger woman caught his eye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIPpdJ-xgGM). He said he did it because he wanted things to go faster, wanted more excitement and, in his words, felt like he could be more himself around her. “Be himself,” of course, meaning be a moody, dour, sexist, boring, condescending, stupid loser. Then Theo showed up, expressed interest in Tyla and turned Jonny into a puddle. Being cocky, Theo noticed this and immediately provoked Jonny, exposing the hairy doof as hugely insecure and an enormous fake tough guy. All Jonny did was bitch about Theo, bitch about Tyla, smoke cigs and look way softer than everyone else. He wins, by a mile.
