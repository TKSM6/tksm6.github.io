<p>Easy target to start off this section, but Dabo Swinney hasn’t said anything stupid lately (the next time he does, he’s right here). I’m not a big award show guy, but I love music much more than I do movies or TV. I’d give both up to have music on my deserted island, if you will.</p>
<p>Anyway, the Grammys were last night, and I could’ve cared less. Not an original stance, I concede, but there’s a reason for that. It’s not the lack of star power, it isn’t the lack of pageantry, it’s not the lack of performances or anything else about <em>the show. The show</em> usually kicks ass–unlimited budget, biggest names, biggest stage.</p>
<p>The Grammy Committee delegitimized their own award–we all know it&rsquo;s rigged. For me, that makes it an unwatchable event. It’s not the whole story, but definitely the tipping point. The way the situation with The Weeknd was handled sealed it for me, but the deal was done long ago. How can you tell a man that can do any event he wants anywhere in the world that he must choose between the Super Bowl and the Grammys? As if. It was a ridiculous move made more ridiculous by their subsequent blackballing of the man’s music at the “premier” music award show on the planet. &ldquo;Blinding Lights&rdquo; was song of the year; I&rsquo;m pretty sure everybody with the financial means to license that song used it for something. The album wasn&rsquo;t his best, but for ~the Grammy audience~ (read between the lines), a better-sounding, better-executed <em>Starboy</em> with the huge single to match should&rsquo;ve be plenty to get it done. But when the Grammys said jump and Weeknd didn’t say “How high?,” his music somehow loses its acclaim. The whites at it again!</p>
<p>Being younger, my introduction to those signature Grammy sham moments was 2014. Hip-hop had arrived by then, but still a step or two away from what it is today. Kendrick had <em>GKMC</em> up for Rap Album of the Year, along with <em>Nothing Was the Same</em>, along with <em>Yeezus</em>, along with a Jay-Z album. And then there was Macklemore.</p>
<p>You know the details, but <em>GKMC</em> turned out to be a defining album of the decade, Kendrick went on to build Top Dawg into one of the best labels in the industry, Kanye is&hellip;doing his thing, Jay is full-blown God status and Drake is kicking off his second decade at the top of the game. Back then, I was just getting deeper into hip-hop, and I had every album up for the award in my phone except the Macklemore one. I always hated &ldquo;Thrift Shop&rdquo; and it still gives me hives. <em>Magna Carta</em> aside (remember, a mid Jay-Z album is still better than 75% of albums), the other three are classic entries in the catalogues of their respective genre icons. But the Grammys said Macklemore had album of the year. Even the man himself didn’t agree. To his credit, Macklemore did what he wanted in the aftermath. He quietly slid out of the public eye after the whole debacle and is enjoying life as a family man and father. He also has a pretty nice golf swing. Good for you, Mack.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2021, and it’s the same dirty diaper, different day. The hip-hop and R&amp;B genres have largely distanced themselves from the award (i.e. they don&rsquo;t show up and tweet things like &ldquo;F*ck the Grammys&rdquo;), but that doesn’t make it meaningless. It’s a goal for lots of artists, it takes a lot to even be considered at that level and there&rsquo;s a lot of history there. The winners are typically deserving, and but that’s about all I’ve got in the way of compliments.</p>
<p>Being run by white people, the Grammys have managed to distance themselves from the genre that dictates culture, defines what is cool, influences how other genres sound like no other and will have the most staying power with future generations. It’s a long-winded way of saying if hip-hop fans and dedicated music fans in general (if you&rsquo;ve ever cut on a Big Booty Mix, that doesn&rsquo;t include you) don’t care now, imagine how little they’ll care in a decade. So congrats to the Grammy board for isolating themselves from the next generation of music fans.</p>
<p>But again, this all stems from THE COMMITTEE. These are the people who decide why and how horrendous decisions continue to be made. Who calls the shots can and will change, but right now it&rsquo;s just another chapter in the story of the committee flipping the collective bird. They are my Haters of the Day because of their willful ignorance. They hear all this (from the people/artists, not me) and continue doing the exact same thing. They’ll always get viewers from the award show watcher freaks, but it’s a music award. Music fans should care. They don’t.</p>
<p><em>Editor&rsquo;s Post Script (3/22/21): I listened to a podcast that made a nuanced observation about this year&rsquo;s show that I hadn&rsquo;t considered. While making the point that this year&rsquo;s event was a showcase of Black excellence, the podcast host pointed out how the record labels flipped the script on the committee this year. Yes, the voting board had the final say on who won, but the labels with the power muscled their artists onto the stage.</em> <a href="https://soundcloud.com/joebuddenpodcast/episode-424-the-nine"><em>Check out the episode here</em></a> <em>(Grammys convo begins around the 20-minute mark).</em></p>
