<p>Yes, I know it&rsquo;s stupid and you don&rsquo;t care, but Lil Nas X has whipped up quite the frenzy on Twitter with the new vid for &ldquo;MONTERO (Call Me By Your Name).&rdquo; Sparknotes version: he&rsquo;s in heaven, descends a CGI stripper pole into hell, red wig swirling around him, to shake ass in the devil&rsquo;s face while wearing thigh-high leather boots and briefs. I&rsquo;d suggest watching it for yourself; there&rsquo;s a lot going on, and it&rsquo;s all very entertaining.</p>

<p>Predictably, the self-appointed gatekeepers of all that is holy and American fired up the faux outrage machine. Nothing new; selective reading on the definition of &ldquo;cancel culture&rdquo; and the invocation of religion/kids to spout racism and homophobia under the guise of &ldquo;protecting our children&rdquo; and &ldquo;restoring traditional American values.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not even that much of a Lil Nas X fan, and I&rsquo;m not telling you to love the song (I personally won&rsquo;t be running it back), love his music or do anything along those lines. He doesn&rsquo;t need my help or support. But because these people are such hypocrites, I simply must call it like I see it.</p>

<p><em>Being a cornball, I enjoy &ldquo;Panini&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The appetizer here is Kristi Noem, the brain-dead, gun-toting governor of South Dakota. If you&rsquo;re wondering what kind of politician she is, she spent last week <a href="https://www.nraila.org/articles/20210324/south-dakota-governor-noem-signs-multiple-pro-gun-bills-into-law">expanding gun rights</a> in the wake of two mass shootings and this week <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/30/politics/south-dakota-transgender-sports-kristi-noem/index.html">cooking up an executive order</a> to bar transgender athletes from participating in K-12 girls sports. Her reasoning was to &ldquo;ensure equality,&rdquo; which she did with a bill codifying inequality for an already-marginalized community. But on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, someone introduced her to Lil Nas X. Knowing in her heart what the orange man would want her to say,  she fired off this snappy little number.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Our kids are being told that this kind of product is, not only okay, it's "exclusive." But do you know what's more exclusive? Their God-given eternal soul.<br><br>We are in a fight for the soul of our nation. We need to fight hard. And we need to fight smart. We have to win. <a href="https://t.co/m1k1YWFpuo">https://t.co/m1k1YWFpuo</a></p>— Governor Kristi Noem (@govkristinoem) <a href="https://twitter.com/govkristinoem/status/1376239196709478400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 28, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>First of all, Kristi, these are fire. I&rsquo;ve always loved 97s. Second of all, God-given eternal soul? I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but if we&rsquo;re talking souls, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/gov-kristi-noem-says-shes-celebrating-intl-womens-day-by-signing-anti-trans-bill">yours is not in the greatest of shape</a>. Just type &ldquo;Kristi Noem scandal&rdquo; into Google for more (mostly <a href="https://prospect.org/power/noem-bill-would-make-dark-money-disclosure-illegal/">misusing taxpayer dollars</a>, <a href="https://www.aberdeennews.com/news/opinion/from-about-41k-to-58k-for-governor-s-daughter/article_fc637b86-1dbc-11ea-b961-db14b62c3554.html">giving a raise to her daughter</a> while bemoaning budget issues and <a href="https://dakotafreepress.com/2019/06/16/girls-stater-expelled-after-posting-photo-of-noem-and-anti-trump-message/">bullying high schoolers</a>). What was it the Bible said about the rich man getting into Heaven? If this is what &ldquo;fight hard, fight smart&rdquo; looks like, I think the rest of us are gonna be just fine.</p>
<p>But the real treat is poopy pants gun girl. I don&rsquo;t know how to spell her name (Caytlin? Kaytlyn? Kaiytliyn?), but I like PPGG as an acronym. Anyway, she hit a triple word score in her responses–racism, homophobia (tweeting &ldquo;At least I can procreate&rdquo;) and victimhood in a Twitter fight she started. All Lil Nas X did was call her &ldquo;shitty pants,&rdquo; and SPGG huffed, puffed and&hellip;went with racism. And for funzies, she claimed Lil Nas X <a href="https://twitter.com/kaitmarieox/status/1376375609555886080">threatened to rape her father</a>. That&rsquo;s right out of the online righty textbook; pick a fight, respond with racism, play the victim when the other person responds, take words out of context.</p>

<p>Are people really this dumb? I know they are, but we&rsquo;ve been having this conversation since before I was born. MUSIC is ART, it is a medium for SELF EXPRESSION. Lil Nas X is an artist who has made it abundantly clear he can, and will, do whatever he damn well pleases. Children will consume art, music especially, and connect with whatever resonates with them (for me, it was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asaCQOZpqUQ">P!nk</a>). If you, as a parent, decide it&rsquo;s inappropriate, that&rsquo;s your prerogative. I&rsquo;ll concede it probably isn&rsquo;t the best thing to show your 8-year-old, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean they can&rsquo;t play <em>the song</em>. You don&rsquo;t have to like the visuals or the song because your tastes are your tastes. But if your gut reaction to this video, or any music video for that matter, is to say &ldquo;THIS is what&rsquo;s wrong with America,&rdquo; you should have your brain examined. What&rsquo;s wrong with America is not a music video; it&rsquo;s an endless list of real-world sh*t that makes our lives worse and has turned this country into a steaming, shameful pile of hate, violence and illness. Also, FWIW, Lil Nas X snaps the devil&rsquo;s neck at the end of the video–he defeated Satan by distracting him with ass. Kristi and PPGG aren&rsquo;t with killing the devil? The soul of this nation may truly be unsafe.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a rollout, folks; bad press is still good press, and this isn&rsquo;t even bad press. None of the outraged parties would&rsquo;ve known about or given a second thought to this song, video, the shoes, etc. if their sh*tty little interns hadn&rsquo;t tucked it away for faux-outrage Monday. WE DID THIS TWO MONTHS AGO WITH &ldquo;WET ASS PUSSY.&rdquo; Naturally, it stands to reason that the &ldquo;Old Town Road&rdquo; guy face-f_cking the devil will be the end of us all. And you&rsquo;re going to hell if you liked anything about it.</p>
<p>Lil Nas X usually walks the line well between trolling and making a point, and I think he&rsquo;s at it again. I&rsquo;d imagine people have been telling LNX he&rsquo;s going to hell ever since he came out as gay (or even before). It would seem he&rsquo;s flipped that notion on its head and went to hell, shall we say, on his terms. He described this song as <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CM3i2RelCkK/">a love letter to his younger self</a>, so that all seems to check out. At the same time, <a href="https://twitter.com/LilNasX/status/1376568409295491081">he told us this was a rollout</a>. LNX came up on Twitter; he&rsquo;s punching down to these clueless, humorless, soulless asswipes. His responses are <em>extremely</em> benign compared to what&rsquo;s being said about him. But you need attention to capitalize on your talent these days, and LNX is doing just that. Stir sh*t, sell records, and if you don&rsquo;t like it, tough toodles.</p>
<p>This won&rsquo;t be a story next week. The right will have moved on to something equally banal and unproductive, and the left will do the same. But stop doing this to music–nobody&rsquo;s making anybody listen to anything. Political music can be great and add a lot to larger conversations, but this is a pop song with some wild visuals. Lo and behold, he&rsquo;s not even the first musician to use Satanic imagery. Let artists create what they want, let people enjoy what resonates with them and, to borrow a talking point from the GOP, mind your business.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altamont_Free_Concert"><em>The story behind this performance</em></a> <em>is worth reading–in short, free concert, too many people, lots of drugs, Hell&rsquo;s Angels as the security, four deaths and a near-shooting of the Rolling Stones. It was carnage; some call it the death of the 60s. Ironically, Ronald Reagan was governor of CA at the time.</em></p>
