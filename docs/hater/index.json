Her reasoning was to \u0026ldquo;ensure equality,\u0026rdquo; which she did with a bill codifying inequality for an already-marginalized community. But on the Lord\u0026rsquo;s Day, someone introduced her to Lil Nas X.

I don\u0026rsquo;t know how to spell her name (Caytlin? Kaytlyn? Kaiytliyn?), but I like PPGG as an acronym. Anyway, she hit a triple word score in her responses–racism, homophobia (tweeting \u0026ldquo;At least I can procreate\u0026rdquo;) and victimhood in a Twitter fight she started. All Lil Nas X did was call her \u0026ldquo;shitty pants,\u0026rdquo; and SPGG huffed, puffed and\u0026hellip;went with racism. And for funzies, she claimed Lil Nas X \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/kaitmarieox/status/1376375609555886080\"\u003ethreatened to rape her father\u003c/a\u003e.

I know they are, but we\u0026rsquo;ve been having this conversation since before I was born. MUSIC is ART, it is a medium for SELF EXPRESSION. Lil Nas X is an artist who has made it abundantly clear he can, and will, do whatever he damn well pleases. Children will consume art, music especially, and connect with whatever resonates with them (for me, it was \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asaCQOZpqUQ\"\u003eP!nk\u003c/a\u003e). If you, as a parent, decide it\u0026rsquo;s inappropriate, that\u0026rsquo;s your prerogative. I\u0026rsquo;ll concede it probably isn\u0026rsquo;t the best thing to show your 8-year-old, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean they can\u0026rsquo;t play \u003cem\u003ethe song\u003c/em\u003e. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to like the visuals or the song because your tastes are your tastes. But if your gut reaction to this video, or any music video for that matter, is to say \u0026ldquo;THIS is what\u0026rsquo;s wrong with America,\u0026rdquo; you should have your brain examined. What\u0026rsquo;s wrong with America is not a music video; it\u0026rsquo;s an endless list of real-world sh*t that makes our lives worse and has turned this country into a steaming, shameful pile of hate, violence and illness. Also, FWIW, Lil Nas X snaps the devil\u0026rsquo;s neck at the end of the video–he defeated Satan by distracting him with ass. Kristi and PPGG aren\u0026rsquo;t with killing the devil? The soul of this nation may truly be unsafe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sLSorLH-FEg\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s a rollout, folks; bad press is still good press, and this isn\u0026rsquo;t even bad press. None of the outraged parties would\u0026rsquo;ve known about or given a second thought to this song, video, the shoes, etc. if their sh*tty little interns hadn\u0026rsquo;t tucked it away for faux-outrage Monday. WE DID THIS TWO MONTHS AGO WITH \u0026ldquo;WET ASS PUSSY.\u0026rdquo; Naturally, it stands to reason that the \u0026ldquo;Old Town Road\u0026rdquo; guy face-f_cking the devil will be the end of us all. And you\u0026rsquo;re going to hell if you liked anything about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLil Nas X usually walks the line well between trolling and making a point, and I think he\u0026rsquo;s at it again. I\u0026rsquo;d imagine people have been telling LNX he\u0026rsquo;s going to hell ever since he came out as gay (or even before). It would seem he\u0026rsquo;s flipped that notion on its head and went to hell, shall we say, on his terms. He described this song as \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CM3i2RelCkK/\"\u003ea love letter to his younger self\u003c/a\u003e, so that all seems to check out. At the same time, \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/LilNasX/status/1376568409295491081\"\u003ehe told us this was a rollout\u003c/a\u003e. LNX came up on Twitter; he\u0026rsquo;s punching down to these clueless, humorless, soulless asswipes. His responses are \u003cem\u003eextremely\u003c/em\u003e benign compared to what\u0026rsquo;s being said about him. But you need attention to capitalize on your talent these days, and LNX is doing just that. Stir sh*t, sell records, and if you don\u0026rsquo;t like it, tough toodles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis won\u0026rsquo;t be a story next week. The right will have moved on to something equally banal and unproductive, and the left will do the same. But stop doing this to music–nobody\u0026rsquo;s making anybody listen to anything. Political music can be great and add a lot to larger conversations, but this is a pop song with some wild visuals. Lo and behold, he\u0026rsquo;s not even the first musician to use Satanic imagery. Let artists create what they want, let people enjoy what resonates with them and, to borrow a talking point from the GOP, mind your business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pqK-J9S2GXs\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altamont_Free_Concert\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe story behind this performance\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003cem\u003eis worth reading–in short, free concert, too many people, lots of drugs, Hell\u0026rsquo;s Angels as the security, four deaths and a near-shooting of the Rolling Stones. It was carnage; some call it the death of the 60s. Ironically, Ronald Reagan was governor of CA at the time.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n"

The show\u003c/em\u003e usually kicks ass–unlimited budget, biggest names, biggest stage, labels muscling their artists into noms and wins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bEe2ohaO8BA\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Grammy Committee delegitimized their own award, to me, because I know it\u0026rsquo;s rigged. That\u0026rsquo;s a \u003cem\u003efan\u003c/em\u003e perspective, because I\u0026rsquo;ve only ever known that side of the equation (clarinet lessons notwithstanding). I can\u0026rsquo;t speak for artists, but \u003ca href=\"https://www.mensxp.com/culture/music/86511-grammys-under-fire-racism-zayn-bts-the-weeknd.html\"\u003ethey\u0026rsquo;ve spoken about it plenty\u003c/a\u003e. \u003ca href=\"https://theundefeated.com/features/dj-jazzy-jeff-the-fresh-prince-and-a-grammy-boycott-that-set-the-tone-for-three-more-decades-of-rap-and-culture/\"\u003eIn pretty clear language\u003c/a\u003e, too. In fact, an artist telling us about the Committee pulling something like this is why I put virtual ink to virtual paper. It’s not the whole story, but definitely the tipping point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way the situation with The Weeknd was handled sealed it for me, but the deal was done long ago. \u003ca href=\"https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/entertainment/a35809227/why-is-weeknd-boycotting-grammys-2021-nomination-snub/\"\u003eHere\u0026rsquo;s a pretty good rundown\u003c/a\u003e (by Good Housekeeping, no less!) that touches on the ultimatum issued by the committee. How can you tell one of the maybe 5 musicians in the world right now that can do any event they want anywhere in the world that he must choose between the Super Bowl and the Grammys? As if. It was a ridiculous move made more flagrant by their subsequent blackballing of the man’s music at the “premier” music award show on the planet. Why else wouldn\u0026rsquo;t he be there?\u0026ldquo;Blinding Lights\u0026rdquo; was song of the year; I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure everybody with the financial means to license that song used it for something. I really liked the album myself; \u0026ldquo;Heartless\u0026rdquo; has to be one of my favorites from him ever, and I probably have half of the songs downloaded. It was a better-sounding, better-executed \u003cem\u003eStarboy\u003c/em\u003e with the huge single to match. \u0026ldquo;Blinding Lights\u0026rdquo; would\u0026rsquo;ve won Song of the Year–point, blank, period. Weeknd would\u0026rsquo;ve probably picked up another 2 or 3 to boot. But when the Grammys said jump and Weeknd didn’t say “how high?,” his music somehow loses its acclaim. For the committee, I suppose it\u0026rsquo;s because Weeknd just did the only live performance that can really rival the Grammys–the Super Bowl Halftime Show. But still, they got pissy and threw this fit, and they look like huge tools. They are, and they\u0026rsquo;ve always acted like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1DpH-icPpl0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing younger, my introduction to those signature Grammy sham moments was 2013. Kendrick had \u003cem\u003eGKMC\u003c/em\u003e up for Rap Album of the Year, along with \u003cem\u003eNothing Was the Same\u003c/em\u003e, along with \u003cem\u003eYeezus\u003c/em\u003e, along with a Jay-Z album. And then there was Macklemore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou know the details, but \u003cem\u003eGKMC\u003c/em\u003e turned out to be a defining album of the decade, Kendrick went on to build Top Dawg into one of the best labels in the industry, Kanye is\u0026hellip;doing his thing, Jay is his own empire and Drake is well on his way. I had every album up for the award in my phone except the Macklemore one. I always hated \u0026ldquo;Thrift Shop\u0026rdquo; and it still gives me hives. \u003cem\u003eMagna Carta\u003c/em\u003e aside (remember, a mid Jay-Z album is still better than 75% of albums), the other three are classic entries in the catalogues of their respective icons. But the Grammys said Macklemore had album of the year. Even the man himself didn’t agree. To his credit, \u003ca href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/grammys-2014-macklemore-apologizes-to-kendrick-lamar-after-best-rap-album-win/\"\u003eafter the weird apology\u003c/a\u003e, Macklemore just kinda kept to himself. He quietly slid out of the public eye after the whole debacle and is enjoying life as a family man and father. He also has a pretty nice golf swing. Good for you, Mack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFast forward to 2021, and it’s the same dirty diaper, different day. The hip-hop and R\u0026amp;B genres have largely distanced themselves from the award (i.e. they don\u0026rsquo;t show up and \u003ca href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2021/03/zayn-malik-tweets-f-the-grammys-clarifies-criticisms.html\"\u003etweet things like \u0026ldquo;F*ck the Grammys\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e), but that doesn’t make it meaningless. It’s a goal for lots of artists, it takes a lot to even be considered at that level and there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of history there. The winners are typically deserving and it\u0026rsquo;s produced some legendary performances (2021 included).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/E61W5osNXK0Xq8aY6h\" width=\"480\" height=\"267\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowFullScreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/recordingacademy-grammys-2021-E61W5osNXK0Xq8aY6h\"\u003evia GIPHY\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing run by white people, the Grammys have managed to distance themselves from the genre that dictates culture, defines what is cool, influences how other genres sound like no other and will have the most staying power with future generations. It’s a long-winded way of saying if young music lovers don’t care now, imagine how little they’ll care in a decade. Artists can keep boycotting\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut again, this all stems from THE COMMITTEE. These are the people who decide why and how horrendous decisions continue to be made. Who calls the shots can and will change, but right now it\u0026rsquo;s just another chapter in the story of the committee flipping the collective bird. They are my Haters of the Day because of their willful ignorance. They hear endless amounts of valid criticism from artists and fans, only to continue doing the exact same thing in the face of intensified scrutiny. . They’ll always get viewers, but the premier matters less and less to music fans with each passing year. How will that bode for its future?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LTPqtO5EbFk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e"
