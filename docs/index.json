I am truly sorry to report that I too have taken that step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not that sorry, actually. Call it 60-40, with indifferent edging out vaguely apologetic. I like to write, so that’s “the point” of all this. As for the title, the full cliche is a mouthful, so I made it snappier. That’s all that’s really going on here (and on most of the internet) anyway–shouting into the void. The content and structure are liable to change; I’ll be throwing stuff at the wall and adding/deleting topics as I go along. For starters, here’s a little roadmap:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSports \u0026amp; Games- Pretty self-explanatory. I’ll reflect on what tickles my fancy from the world of sports while also dipping into some niche pursuits like racing, the Olympics, cycling, golf, white people country club sports and the five ring clown show known colloquially as sports media.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMassholery– Dedicated to the culture I grew up in, know the best and love the most: Boston sports fandom. This will also be a catch-all for any related musings on the great state of Massachusetts and its people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHater of the Day– Since people allocate their time and energy to taking a dump on and/or tearing down people who don’t look, talk or think like them, I’ll return the favor here when necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMusic– The first blog I inflicted on the world was about music, so I’ll pop in here with some of my favorites, new stuff and whatever nonsense artists find themselves involved in. I’m partial to R\u0026amp;B and hip-hop, so don’t come in here looking for the Luke Bryan album rankings or an Enya blog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRantings, Ravings \u0026amp; Stories– More or less the miscellaneous section. Since most of my thoughts eventually condense into rant form, there should be plenty of those. There will also be some “funny” stories about colorful characters I’ve met over the years, days where I embarrassed myself immensely, that sort of thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though I’m doing this for ME and not YOU, I welcome any and all feedback. That inevitably shades more toward negativity, but you’re allowed to say nice things too. Drop me and email or mention if you feel strongly enough, and (no joke) thanks for reading.\u003c/p\u003e\n"
