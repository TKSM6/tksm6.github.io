      <title>HotD 3/16- The Grammy Committee</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Easy target to start off this section, but Dabo Swinney hasn’t said anything stupid lately (the next time he does, he’s right here). I’m not a big award show guy, but I love music much more than I do movies or TV. I’d give both up to have music on my deserted island, if you will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the Grammys were last night, and I could’ve cared less. Not an original stance, I concede, but there’s a reason for that. It’s not the lack of star power, it isn’t the lack of pageantry, it’s not the lack of performances or anything else about &lt;em&gt;the show. The show&lt;/em&gt; usually kicks ass–unlimited budget, biggest names, biggest stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Grammy Committee delegitimized their own award–we all know it&amp;rsquo;s rigged. For me, that makes it an unwatchable event. It’s not the whole story, but definitely the tipping point. The way the situation with The Weeknd was handled sealed it for me, but the deal was done long ago. How can you tell a man that can do any event he wants anywhere in the world that he must choose between the Super Bowl and the Grammys? As if. It was a ridiculous move made more ridiculous by their subsequent blackballing of the man’s music at the “premier” music award show on the planet. &amp;ldquo;Blinding Lights&amp;rdquo; was song of the year; I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure everybody with the financial means to license that song used it for something. The album wasn&amp;rsquo;t his best, but for ~the Grammy audience~ (read between the lines), a better-sounding, better-executed &lt;em&gt;Starboy&lt;/em&gt; with the huge single to match should&amp;rsquo;ve be plenty to get it done. But when the Grammys said jump and Weeknd didn’t say “How high?,” his music somehow loses its acclaim. The whites at it again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being younger, my introduction to those signature Grammy sham moments was 2014. Hip-hop had arrived by then, but still a step or two away from what it is today. Kendrick had &lt;em&gt;GKMC&lt;/em&gt; up for Rap Album of the Year, along with &lt;em&gt;Nothing Was the Same&lt;/em&gt;, along with &lt;em&gt;Yeezus&lt;/em&gt;, along with a Jay-Z album. And then there was Macklemore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know the details, but &lt;em&gt;GKMC&lt;/em&gt; turned out to be a defining album of the decade, Kendrick went on to build Top Dawg into one of the best labels in the industry, Kanye is&amp;hellip;doing his thing, Jay is full-blown God status and Drake is kicking off his second decade at the top of the game. Back then, I was just getting deeper into hip-hop, and I had every album up for the award in my phone except the Macklemore one. I always hated &amp;ldquo;Thrift Shop&amp;rdquo; and it still gives me hives. &lt;em&gt;Magna Carta&lt;/em&gt; aside (remember, a mid Jay-Z album is still better than 75% of albums), the other three are classic entries in the catalogues of their respective genre icons. But the Grammys said Macklemore had album of the year. Even the man himself didn’t agree. To his credit, Macklemore did what he wanted in the aftermath. He quietly slid out of the public eye after the whole debacle and is enjoying life as a family man and father. He also has a pretty nice golf swing. Good for you, Mack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to 2021, and it’s the same dirty diaper, different day. The hip-hop and R&amp;amp;B genres have largely distanced themselves from the award (i.e. they don&amp;rsquo;t show up and tweet things like &amp;ldquo;F*ck the Grammys&amp;rdquo;), but that doesn’t make it meaningless. It’s a goal for lots of artists, it takes a lot to even be considered at that level and there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of history there. The winners are typically deserving, and but that’s about all I’ve got in the way of compliments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being run by white people, the Grammys have managed to distance themselves from the genre that dictates culture, defines what is cool, influences how other genres sound like no other and will have the most staying power with future generations. It’s a long-winded way of saying if hip-hop fans and dedicated music fans in general (if you&amp;rsquo;ve ever cut on a Big Booty Mix, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t include you) don’t care now, imagine how little they’ll care in a decade. So congrats to the Grammy board for isolating themselves from the next generation of music fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But again, this all stems from THE COMMITTEE. These are the people who decide why and how horrendous decisions continue to be made. Who calls the shots can and will change, but right now it&amp;rsquo;s just another chapter in the story of the committee flipping the collective bird. They are my Haters of the Day because of their willful ignorance. They hear all this (from the people/artists, not me) and continue doing the exact same thing. They’ll always get viewers from the award show watcher freaks, but it’s a music award. Music fans should care. They don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor&amp;rsquo;s Post Script (3/22/21): I listened to a podcast that made a nuanced observation about this year&amp;rsquo;s show that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t considered. While making the point that this year&amp;rsquo;s event was a showcase of Black excellence, the podcast host pointed out how the record labels flipped the script on the committee this year. Yes, the voting board had the final say on who won, but the labels with the power muscled their artists onto the stage.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/joebuddenpodcast/episode-424-the-nine&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check out the episode here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Grammys convo begins around the 20-minute mark).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Playlist and a Story (R&amp;B)</title>
      <link>https://thepileTKSM.com/music/a-playlist-and-a-story-r-b/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 14 Mar 2021 22:30:01 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Right before the pandemic started, I went with a pair of friends to a &amp;ldquo;club&amp;rdquo; (large bar) north of The Loop in Chicago called Emporium. It was my first time, but I&amp;rsquo;m generally unconcerned about the specifics of such an establishment and more interested in the fact that I can buy an adult beverage there. Accordingly, I had no idea what I was walking into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rewinding a bit, I was not in the best form that evening. I had managed to ring my own bell (usually you can find someone at the spot to do that for you) at my buddies&#39; house before striking out. While tossing a basketball to myself, I lightly tossed it off the underside of one of those doorway pull-up bars. Much to my surprise, it dislodged itself from the frame and dropped squarely onto the bridge of my nose. It hurt a bit, but I shook it off, tried and failed to reinstall the bar and ended up just leaning it against the wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I came around the corner into the kitchen, one of my friends looked up and was immediately confused.&amp;ldquo;Jake, why are you bleeding?&amp;rdquo; My nose was still a bit numb, but just then I felt something warm on my face. I ducked into the bathroom, flicked on the light and saw that I was indeed bleeding. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything major, but the bar had peeled off a sizable flap on skin on its way down my nose. Given the trail of blood started right between my eyes, it was tough to miss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Uber was under 10 minutes out. Knowing little about how nose cuts but far more about how unable I was to be my own doctor, I figured the skin flap would need to stay, a Band-Aid was a no-go and that my best bet was a wet tissue. I pinned one on the cut, stopped the bleeding and felt pretty good about my future as a medic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was waiting around and laughing it off, the physical act of smiling cracked the scab and opened the cut again. Normally, not being able to smile would play right into my hands, but I was out of time. I snatched a fresh tissue and piled into the backseat holding it to my nose. Fortunately for me, a 25-minute ride gives the human body plenty of time to do its thing and staunch the bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I looked around Emporium, I noticed there weren&amp;rsquo;t a lot of white people there, and the ones that were there had huddled in the back around some pinball machines. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to hear the Chainsmokers or Party in the USA from the DJ booth, so I was very pleased by this development_._ I snagged a couple Old Styles because they were $3 and shimmied over to the dance floor. I soon discovered it was 90s R&amp;amp;B night, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have been any happier. I came to love the genre in the 2010s, but like any music fan, I know enough of the classics to be more than content with that selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a couple more adult beverages, I was ready to unlock my joints a bit. I shuffled toward the back of the room and found a bit of space to be a spazz without bumping into any couples trying to enjoy their evening. I thought I was blending in fine, but a white dude with a large cut on his nose dancing oddly and looking kind of sweaty with a beer in hand caught a few eyes in a sea of young, in love Black couples. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really get into R&amp;amp;B until ~10 years after the era being featured, so I was mostly just singing the hooks, looking crazy and butchering some dance moves. Come to think of it, the Old Styles probably tipped everyone else off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, a group of Black women took pity on me. One of them tapped me on the shoulder, saying &amp;ldquo;You look like you need some help.&amp;rdquo; Then she took a step back to do a full appraisal–no rhythm, cheap beer, no significant other, a newly healed cut. At that point, I stopped trying to dance all together. I figured she must be spot-on; if she and her friends felt compelled enough to approach me, I must really be in a state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman who spoke up first then said something along the lines of, &amp;ldquo;Let me show you some steps.&amp;rdquo; I gladly took her up on the offer because I know I can&amp;rsquo;t dance and free lessons weren&amp;rsquo;t often forthcoming. She got me back on beat, the friend group had a couple more chuckles at my footwork and finally I &lt;em&gt;kinda&lt;/em&gt; had the hang of it. Unfortunately, the DJ cut on an Aaliyah song, the universal signal to GTFO. Upon hearing that story on the ride home, my kinder friend said she was trying to kick a little game to me; everyone else was far less kind in their assessment. I tend to agree with the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, during the first month or so of the pandemic, I fixated on that night a lot. My longings to go dance, drink, hear loud music and people-watch were crystalized by that rather ordinary Friday night; I had expected nothing and instead had a fabulous time. I just wanted to be able to do that again (and still do). But while at Emporium, I remember thinking I&amp;rsquo;d look a lot cooler if the songs were from 5-10 years later and I could base my ungainly movements on a tempo and lyrics I knew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I made a playlist: THE EMPORIUM BAG. It&amp;rsquo;s some late 90s/early 2000s R&amp;amp;B that I love and that would still do something in the right room. You&amp;rsquo;ll find some B, some Mariah, some Trey, some newer stuff from the Summer Walker/Ella Mai lane, etc. The theme is R&amp;amp;B for your night out–something with a little bounce, something you probably heard on the radio and (hopefully) something that will bring back some good memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;[https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/2WpZuTqMAoqFWIAnxwmmjE](https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/2WpZuTqMAoqFWIAnxwmmjE &#34;https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/2WpZuTqMAoqFWIAnxwmmjE&#34;)&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;380&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34; allow=&#34;encrypted-media&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</description>

      <title>My Favorite Brand of (NBA) Rebuild </title>
      <link>https://thepileTKSM.com/sports-and-games/my-favorite-brand-of-nba-rebuild/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 14 Mar 2021 21:25:05 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://thepileTKSM.com/sports-and-games/my-favorite-brand-of-nba-rebuild/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ah, the rebuild. It can be a shame to witness as a fan, an even bigger shame when the front office doesn’t know how to handle it. There are degrees to the art; a full teardown and rebuild, on-the-fly in the mediocre zone, endless searching for complementary pieces, etc. The OKC Thunder are in the midst of a great one–outside looking in on the playoff picture, but with a play-in seed ceiling, marked growth from their young star and a well-conceived supporting cast. The Suns deserve a mention here as well, but they&amp;rsquo;re enjoying their first season of being truly competitive. We’ll stick to the NBA for the purposes of this blog because the smaller roster size best illustrates my favorite type of rebuild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that would be…those rare, beautiful seasons where your rebuild is just spare parts cast off from other rebuilds. There’s a couple ways to get here as a team, but it typically involves some combination of the following: young pieces that aren’t ready, limited cap space from bad contracts left over from aging stars/pieces, a need to “make something happen” (i.e. fill a roster). Maybe sprinkle in a new coach/GM, add a dash of underperforming holdovers, a pinch of low expectations and you’ve got the perfect scenario to bring in a bunch of spare parts and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it my favorite type of rebuild? Because it’s as close as we get to an actual island of misfit toys. It also produces some head-scratching rosters (think this season’s Pistons, last year&amp;rsquo;s Wizards/Knicks). I go back to the 2018-19 Bulls, a team I watched far too much of, as an example. Their best player was Zack Lavine, who they got in the Jimmy Butler trade with Minnesota. Ditto for Kris Dunn, ditto for Lauri Markkanen (who they took with that Wolves pick). Aside from Wendell Carter Jr. and Chandler Hutchinson (both rookies), all contributors of note were castoffs from other rebuilds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otto Porter Jr. came over midseason after the Wizards realized their window was being slammed shut and somehow decided Bobby Portis and Jabari Parker were the answer. TLC was a Process cast-off. Justin Holiday (an OG Processor) was back for a second stint after bopping around the league. Cam Payne and Robin Lopez were both consummate journeymen. Aside from Lopez, Holiday and Porter, nobody had more than 5 years NBA service at the start of the season. Oh, and they fired Fred Hoiberg (meh) midseason for Jim Boylen (much, much worse).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason you don’t build cars out of spare parts is because they run like ass and break down. Same rules apply to basketball teams; for that Bulls roster, 22-60 was how they ran. But there&amp;rsquo;s always someone in that zone. It takes a couple years, some bad decisions, the wrong people at the wheel and some bad luck, but it happens. At times, it’s a necessary evil; those high-priced dudes you shipped out need replacements, but you swung and missed at the top levels of free agency (hi 2010s Knicks, small market teams). Your lottery pick(s) isn’t ready, but he needs playing time. You want a strong bench to support your dream starting 5 down the road, but first you gotta see who out of the washed-up free agents and non-lottery draft picks are worth a flier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that said, sometimes it works. I&amp;rsquo;m harkening again, this time back to one of my favorite teams–the 2016-17 Celtics. For those who forget, they somehow finished first in the East, finagled their way into the ECF and got blown out by year one of the LeBron Cavs 2.0. It’s not a perfect example; Brown (year 2), Tatum (rookie), Rozier, Avery Bradley and Olynk were all Boston draft picks, but everything really came together right between the post-Big 3 rock bottom phase and and the Tatum-Brown core of today. Al Horford was the first big name free agent to come to town in years, but only because he saw the writing on the wall for the Bud Hawks. Other than that, the rotation was filled out with a bunch of names that wouldn’t strike fear into many hearts; Jae Crowder, Tyler Zeller, Jonas Jerebko, Gerald Green and Amir Johnson all played A LOT of minutes. And then there’s Isaiah Thomas, jettisoned from the Suns rebuild (remember their &lt;a href=&#34;https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2246377-3-point-guard-lineup-is-best-blueprint-for-phoenix-suns-success&#34;&gt;triple point guard experiment?&lt;/a&gt;) only to have one of the most electric single seasons by a mediocre player in recent memory. Much of the credit goes to Brad Stevens for bringing the best out of that roster, but there’s something to be said for the players themselves making it work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you have teams like last year&amp;rsquo;s Knicks. Let&amp;rsquo;s remove R.J. Barrett, Mitchell Robinson, Frank Ntilikina and Kevin Knox (I guess) from the equation as the &amp;ldquo;young core&amp;rdquo; and Julius Randle as a good signing that&amp;rsquo;s paying off tremendously this season. But the rest? Taj Gibson&amp;rsquo;s brightest days were with the D-Rose Bulls, but even Minnesota–another offender here–couldn&amp;rsquo;t bring themselves to give him minutes. Boston decided Marcus Morris Sr. too expensive, and he was out. Both the Bulls and Wizards deemed Bobby Portis unfit for their own rebuilds. Higher up the food chain, the Blazers had no time for Mo Harkless and the Magic did the same to Elfrid Payton. The PISTONS saw half a season of both Wayne Ellington and Reggie Bullock before concluding they were not the solution. Dennis Smith Jr.&amp;rsquo;s lack of staying power has been similarly well-documented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Point being, the spare parts rebuild usually goes poorly, but it’s not a death sentence. Hell, those seasons help you find a couple bench guys to tie your rotation together, give your draft picks some run (since the rest of your roster stinks) and teach your front office about failed rolls of the dice, both in the draft and free agency. When they stink, it’s expected, and if they overachieve, it’s a lot of fun as a fan. That volatility is what I love– never knowing what you’ll get, who’s going to win you a game, who’s cooked and who still has something left. Even as a Celtics fan today (and I&amp;rsquo;m sure plenty would agree), you get nostalgic for the surprisingly-good rebuild seasons, especially when later teams that are supposed to be good underperform. Knicks and Suns fans especially seem to be having those first fun years after a long rebuild, so be sure support them in their fun.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Baseball Cards are Survivors</title>
      <link>https://thepileTKSM.com/rants-and-stories/cards-i-used-to-know/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 12 Mar 2021 02:37:22 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://thepileTKSM.com/rants-and-stories/cards-i-used-to-know/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Baseball cards are one of the few “relics” that remain popular, both with nostalgics, a bit with modern kids and now, via a leap online, NFTs (I’m not talking about those because I don’t know enough). There aren’t many others; bikes and skateboards come to mind, dolls and dollhouses too, I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are more. But even I, someone who mostly grew up in the 21st century, feel like an old man when thinking about what kids are raised on today. I never had video games (because of my parents), wasn’t really on the internet until middle school and walked around with a flip phone in my pocket until high school. My sister, three years younger, had a smartphone by the time she got to 9th grade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that the baseball card, and the sports card in general, made it to my generation is a minor miracle. Baseball has been badly outstripped by football and basketball in the minds, lives and feeds of American kids. I can’t speak much on modern children considering I have none, but I imagine sports cards don’t quite match up to Candy Crush or an Xbox. And yet, they survive. I can appreciate its timeless appeal for a kid that loves sports with the cool pictures, stats, collector’s appeal. But you can’t play games on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember the first pack of cards I got. It was an old box set of 100+ from the late 80s/early 90s made of the flimsy, papery material that was the norm back then. My dad picked them up from Ocean State Job Lot. For those not from the Northeast, is basically a Walmart with weirder, cheaper stuff. Finding a box of 25-year-old baseball cards is par for the course. I’d say they couldn’t have cost more than $10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point, I was eight or nine years old and a full-blown Red Sox fan following their curse–busting World Series win in ’04. Of course, I had no idea who any of the players in the old set were. I recognized Tony Gwynn, but only because his son was playing in the MLB by that point. But my love for cards arose from something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not long after I got that first set, one of my parents came home with a binder. Inside the binder were plastic pages with 12 little sleeves on them. Far from a child prodigy, I was confused about their purpose. They were for the cards and, newly enlightened, I set about organizing. I found countless ways to sort and order the cards; by team, color, position, last name and more. As I expanded my collection beyond baseball, I got more binders. Still, they were all dwarfed by the mammoth two-incher stuffed to the brim with random baseball players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By then, I had advanced to current players. At the time (roughly ’05-’08), Topps were the easiest to find, so that’s what I bought. There were two card stores I frequented, both of which went under by 2010. They were little holes-in-the-wall, one on Main Street in Melrose and the other at the top of the Neck in Fairhaven. They were remarkably similar in layout and merchandise; long, narrow rooms filled with sports memorabilia and other relevant odds and ends. I would beg my dad to take me in each time we drove by, and he often would. A pack of cards was cheap (maybe $7), so the collection grew quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would spend hours on the floor sorting. Each time a new pack or set arrived, all the cards had to come out. I would create little piles on the living room carpet based on that day’s organizational technique. It was a good activity for muggy summer days when going outside meant heatstroke wasn’t far off. It would take hours, but I was totally engrossed. Occasionally, I found trade partners (like real baseball!). I’d take a stack of players on the block over to friend’s houses and start dealing. I’d like to think I made some shrewd moves in my day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After amassing a sizable collection, I decided to figure out what it was worth. Being a child and knowing nothing about card collecting or sales, I assumed quantity equated to value. I received a card index from a relative for my birthday and set about totaling up my collection. As I soon realized, most of the cards I owned were worth a whopping…10 cents. The most valuable one I had was a Nomar (Nomahhhhhh) Cubs card that had a piece of his bat embedded. That went for a tasty…five dollars. All told, the collection was basically worthless. They’re still in my childhood bedroom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come to think of it, collecting baseball cards taught me a lot about organizing. As I progressed through school, I found I was much more put together than my peers when it came to tasks such as not losing homework. Can a direct line be drawn? Probably not, but it didn’t hurt. I’m sure kids everywhere could tell stories about the weird stuff they loved back in the day that somehow helped them down the road, and mine was baseball cards. And despite technology, despite the state of baseball, I reckon they’ll stick around a bit longer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Last Time I Didn&#39;t Make it to the Bathroom</title>
      <link>https://thepileTKSM.com/rants-and-stories/the-last-time-i-didn-t-make-it-to-the-bathroom/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2021 02:33:03 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://thepileTKSM.com/rants-and-stories/the-last-time-i-didn-t-make-it-to-the-bathroom/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Oddly enough, the last time I crapped myself occurred at a point in my life when I was in far better physical shape than I am now. Usually, as your health deteriorates, the ability to hold your solid waste also deteriorates. Defecating oneself is also a problem that mostly affects the two age groups at the tips of the human bell curve; infants and the elderly. A teenager, however, is thought to be approaching the prime of their physical powers and certainly not a likely candidate for such an episode. But, alas, life is funny sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before diving into my tale of misery and woe, a couple disclaimers. First, there is no shame in such an event ONCE EVERY FEW YEARS. Sh*t happens; we’ve all been marooned in traffic or on the train or somewhere inexplicably lacking a commode when that feeling hits. If nothing else, I hope you found a bathroom in the aftermath of your little accident to try and piece back together whatever remains of your pride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, skid marks do not count. I’m going to be talking about a complete bowel release, not a little rosebud left for the laundry. Finally, one more request. As you read this story, see if you can remember the last time (or any time, for that matter) that it happened to you. It’s a humorous way to sift through your memory because, as I’ve long maintained, poop is always funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In high school, I rowed competitively for four years; we raced in the fall and the spring, trained outside in the summer and spent winters on the machines in what was also the wrestling room. It was journey of mediocrity interspersed with brief flashes of brilliance that afforded me some neat opportunities to race in exotic locales such as St. Catherine’s, Ontario. For those who don’t know, SC sits just 20 minutes over the American border, meaning it is simply an extension of northwestern New York. But because it is technically Canada, the businesses you would expect to see in a similar American town were masquerading under pseudonyms. For example, SportChek is Dick’s Sporting Goods, Tim Horton’s is Dunkin’ Donuts, etc. However, the one universal name brand store that will ultimately catalyze my little incident shone like a beacon in a wasteland of Canadian knockoffs, beckoning warmly to a hungry pack of American teenagers looking to eat as much as possible as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I am not a big chain pizza guy; I’ve spent most of my life in the Boston area and the Chicago area, two major metropolitan locations with actual pizza restaurants that serve actual pizza. In a pinch, I will absolutely indulge in some Domino’s, but again, not my thing. But this was our first night in Canada, nobody had a car, and we were traveling in a group of 20 on foot. With options and daylight dwindling, the red roof of Pizza Hut hove into view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, this was the worst chain pizza restaurant I have ever been to–any brand, any state, any country. It took over an hour for them to make four calzones; four PIZZA HUT calzones. I don’t remember much about how it tasted, probably because I don’t want to. Let’s just assumed it sucked and keep moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we had been stuffed in the back of a van for 10 hours, I wolfed down my quadrant. I thought nothing of it until the next morning at 5 AM, when I found myself parked on the toilet pissing out of my ass. Now normally, ass pee can be managed with ease; don’t get too adventurous, plan your day carefully around locations with bathrooms you know and love, and wait for whatever it was that caused the brown rain to leave your system. In my experience, it’s a 12-to-24 hour phenomenon at the most and occasionally results in just two or three runny, loud dumps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the reason I was up at 5 AM was because I had to be on the water at 6 AM to practice for the week’s races. I wasn’t worried yet; it felt like I had eliminated most of the offending calzone on the first try, and my stomach wasn’t particularly sore. I figured I could make it two or three hours and thought nothing of it until the precise moment we pushed off the dock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who have never sat in a rowing shell, there is no bathroom on board. You sit about six inches off the water in a boat just wider than your hips, and you have about three feet to operate front to back. The issues for me began there; I had nowhere to go. I couldn’t jump into the water, I couldn’t force the boat back to shore because practice time was at a premium, and I certainly couldn’t let it go. That meant sitting there trying to row (a fairly strenuous, full-body physical activity) and not think about the storm brewing in my lower intestine or the fact that I easily could have nipped off to the bathroom before we started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Pizza Hut calzone was far from finished with me, and about an hour into practice it was two-foot dropkicking the backdoor. I suffered silently, unable to do anything except clench as hard as I possibly could. It was exhausting work, and ten minutes from time I gave in. Even if I held on a bit longer, I would have lost it on the dock or on my way to the porta-potty. It was actually the best place for me to have a situation that day; because it was, of course, diarrhea , the viscosity of the turd allowed it to be quickly washed off the deck of the boat with a couple quick splashes of water. I rinsed down my legs and water bottle while I was at it, actually feeling pretty good about the whole thing heading to land. The black spandex hid the discoloration, the water washed away the evidence and the lake breeze took care of the smell. As I hustled around the staging area looking for a porta-potty, I really thought I might just get away with this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the final, cruelest twist of fate, I had actually picked the worst place on planet earth to shit myself. The bathrooms at a sporting event are about as prehistoric as the modern man gets, but rowing regattas are a different animal because they bring the porta-potty into play. There were hundreds of teams at this race, each with dozens of athletes and coaches, and precisely zero indoor commodes. It was the first week of August, and like the country it tries so hard to imitate, Canada also gets very, very hot around that time of the year. There were MAYBE six plastic palaces within reach, and all of them had been marinating in the sun for several days at the mercy of rather large athletes consuming their body weight in carbs. It was, for lack of a better word, a sh*tstorm of epic proportions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first hopper I visited made me gag, and there was no toilet paper. That would become a recurring theme, so eventually I got desperate. There was still residue on my ass and my thighs, but I had nothing to wipe with. I ran back to my bag and grabbed the only article of clothing I could spare: my boxers. I boogied back over to the nearest potty and tried to wipe the (now dry) refuse off myself before launching the underwear, the spandex shorts I had been wearing and my socks into the toilet. I allowed myself a brief, ultimately premature, sigh of relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there were no visible signs of my ordeal, I had been missing for ten minutes and returned clearly free-balling in my gym shorts. Luckily for me, I was at a rowing event, a place where men can walk around naked save for a spandex diaper and nobody bats an eye. However, I quickly realized I needed to pass one more level before I could get a proper shower–the van ride back to the hotel. Remember, it’s August, and the van has been in the lot baking for three hours. I had been sitting in my own feces for the better part of an hour, and the extent of my cleaning was a quick wipe down with a pair of thin boxers. Packed into a hot van, that lingering smell bloomed. But my savior on this occasion was something I don’t think has ever benefitted me at any other time; the pungent, overwhelming body odor of the teenage male. Still, once the door closed, one sharp-nosed teammate was kind enough to point out, &amp;ldquo;It smells like s*** in here.&amp;rdquo; I kept my head down, my shirt over my nose, and twenty minutes later I took another horrific dump before finally getting into the shower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put a bow on this overwritten tale, nobody found out that the smell was me. Rather, nobody confronted me directly about it, even though I imagine the young man sitting behind me in the boat that day knew exactly what happened (he now works for Sean Hannity. I hope I got some crap on him). The calzone ravaged my lower intestine for the rest of the day and much of the next, but I wasn’t good enough to be rowing that often and managed to find a toilet each time brown rain entered the forecast. I have no idea what happened; I’m not lactose intolerant or allergic to any foods, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to place 100% of the blame on the Pizza Hut in St. Catherine&amp;rsquo;s, Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most stories this long provide some sort of life lesson or deep insight into human nature, none of which I have handy. Still, I’ll do you the unnecessary courtesy of revealing what this little accident taught me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be ashamed to poop yourself (once every few years, if nobody finds out).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be wary of chain pizza.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are never in total control of your own anus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>The 2020 Patriots Weren&#39;t Good...and that&#39;s ok</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote a different version of this blog after Week 13, when the Pats sat at 6-6. Unlike the real sports journos of yore, I did not make a promise to eat my own column should my sage predictions be proven wrong. I also didn’t get it published in time. Or anywhere, for that matter. And yet here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, that version was quite a bit different. It started off with something about going 8-4 and deteriorated from there. I’ll spare you the details, but please know it came from a part of my brain that still thought the dynasty was alive. And I’m glad it never saw the light of day because you might confuse me for a Pats fanboy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a card-carrying Pats fanboy still a bit hungover from the glory of my childhood/teenage year/college years, but this season was a slow motion kick to the bits. I imagine most Pats fans agree. It’s long overdue in the grand scheme of things; I loosely equate it to last year’s Warriors team minus the top 2 pick at the end of the shitbow. FWIW, our reign of terror was much longer anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any Pats fan with a brain stem had lower expectations for this season. Sure, you said they’d win the division after Cam Newton signed, but you weren’t alone (regionally). No matter how sweet his black-and-white offseason training videos looked, reality was bound to set in. The man had to replace the greatest QB of all time, during a global pandemic, after his new team logged the most opt-outs in the NFL, and with a receiving/tight end corps that was, uh, thin at best and useless at worst (hi N’Keal!). You can’t be &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; surprised the offense had severe growing pains; one man creates a system with the same coordinator and runs it to perfection for 10+ years. It stands to reason 1 A.T. would be tough. Cam never got the time or prep he needed, and his body was never right. Add in his pass catchers, COVID, canceled bye week, you catch my drift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pats lost some games they shouldn’t have in 2020, but they won a lot of games (big games) they shouldn’t have over the past two-ish decades. It was to be expected, really; remove Tom Brady from the equation, watch that win percentage in those games dip. Some of them were maddening–the Edelman fumble vs. SEA and Cam vs. BUF stand out–but that is what we’ve watched other fanbases deal with for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to me, the Patriots were entertaining, even when they lost. I respect the limited amount of blowouts, the commitment to lingering just long enough to make me watch the 4th quarter and the newfound ability to shoot themselves in the foot in key situations. We even got to play the “In the Hunt” game for a couple weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as a Pats fan, you can’t be that mad. You took a shot on a former MVP for a bargain, and even though he didn&amp;rsquo;t hit his stride, you never heard a bad thing about Cam from the locker room or media. Bill’s still there, Josh is still there (for now), and a cohort of Belichick sons and former linebackers should have the defense covered. Sony Michel and Damien Harris ought to be an above-average backfield tandem for the next few years. They found enough low-ceiling, high-effort guys to plug the gaps and keep things vaguely interesting. I&amp;rsquo;m sure Jakobi Meyers and Damiere Byrd earned another look. We were also introduced to a couple keepers on defense–Josh Uche and Kyle Dugger most notably. The O-line did a bang-up job, especially considering it was pretty easy to plan for a run-based attack. Special teams were stellar, per usual (shoutout to Jake Bailey and the old man Nick Folk).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty of disappointments too. Receivers and tight ends, obviously, but no Edelman hurt. N’Keal Harry continuing the trend of crappy Day 1 receiver picks wasn’t pleasant, and the same could be said about the lack of production from the tight end position. The defense couldn’t knuckle down consistently enough when they needed stops, especially against the run. But most obvious, at least to the casual eye, were the screwups in key situations–turnovers, penalties, can’t-get-a-key-stop, stalled drives. It’s not to say they didn’t catch their share of breaks or didn’t make ANY clutch plays. It was just a striking difference–especially when you built a dynasty on winning those pivotal moments of football games–to continue finding your team on the other side of that equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But again, nothing more than a mild air of disappointment from me on this Pats season. The playoffs were still compelling, with plenty of juicy storylines for Pats fans. A quick rundown: the Big Ben era is over in Pittsburgh (he resigned, I know, but c&amp;rsquo;mon), Buffalo taking up the mantle for the AFC East, everyone caught up with John Harbaugh again. Even the ones with no loose connection were fun: Browns won a game! Extra wild card teams! One bye! Crying Drew Brees! COVID hanging over everything! Patty Mahomes isn&amp;rsquo;t worth his contract (he is)! The NFC was never actually that good! Oh, and the old man got his 7th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pats fans, I hope you enjoyed some playoff football with no deeply personal, unnecessarily weighty emotions riding on it. Throw on a championship DVD if you’re feeling down about your team–there’s six to choose from. And look forward to next year; Bill will have his last laugh, one way or another. It might not be next year, but history suggests you might want to stick around and find out.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every white man worth their mediocrity has a blog or a podcast or a Twitch stream or some way to project their ego and inflict their opinions on the world. I am truly sorry to report that I too have taken that step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not that sorry, actually. Call it 60-40, with indifferent edging out vaguely apologetic. I like to write, so that’s “the point” of all this. Now, the title. I remember in Catholic school they used to tell us &amp;ldquo;everyone carries around their own invisible cross.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s an unimaginative way to say everyone carries their own invisible burdens. In my mind, everyone has their own pile of crap they sit on. We all have one, they all look different, some are bigger than others and everyday we go and confront, wrestle with, try to clean up our pile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content and structure are liable to change; I’ll be throwing stuff at the wall and adding/deleting topics as I go along. For starters, here’s a little roadmap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sports &amp;amp; Games&lt;/strong&gt;- Pretty self-explanatory. I’ll reflect on what tickles my fancy from the world of sports while also dipping into some niche pursuits like racing, the Olympics, cycling, golf, white people country club sports and the five ring clown show known colloquially as sports media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Massholery&lt;/strong&gt;– Dedicated to the culture I grew up in, know the best and love the most: Boston sports fandom. This will also be a catch-all for any related musings on the great state of Massachusetts and its people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hater of the Day&lt;/strong&gt;– Since people allocate their time and energy to taking a dump on and/or tearing down people who don’t look, talk or think like them, I’ll return the favor here when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Music&lt;/strong&gt;– The first blog I inflicted on the world was about music, so I’ll pop in here with some of my favorites, new stuff and whatever nonsense artists find themselves involved in. I’m partial to R&amp;amp;B and hip-hop, so don’t come in here looking for the Luke Bryan album rankings or an Enya blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rantings, Ravings &amp;amp; Stories&lt;/strong&gt;– More or less the miscellaneous section. Since most of my thoughts eventually condense into rant form, there should be plenty of those. There will also be some “funny” stories about colorful characters I’ve met over the years, days where I embarrassed myself immensely, that sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I’m doing this for ME and not YOU, I welcome any and all feedback. That inevitably shades toward negativity, but you’re allowed to say nice things too. Drop me and email or &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/May6Jake&#34;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; if you feel strongly enough, and (no joke) thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;
