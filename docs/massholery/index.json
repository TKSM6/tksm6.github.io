I\u0026rsquo;m mentally prepared for the news to break sometime this summer, but until then, nothing but happy thoughts.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe top story out of Foxborough last week was Julian Edelman\u0026rsquo;s retirement, and I am sad. Not for him–his knee is shot, he made his money and I\u0026rsquo;d suspect he\u0026rsquo;s got a bright life after football waiting for him in front of whatever camera he chooses. We saw the wheels falling off a bit last season; anytime an older player attempts, and then aborts, a comeback from a tough injury, there\u0026rsquo;s probably a reason why. But doling out flowers to those who deserve them is never a bad idea, and I\u0026rsquo;d like to do so for Jules.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jo-4xrRErvk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a fan, I first knew Edelman as knockoff Wes Welker, then the other guy \u003ca href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/151433606194509219/\"\u003ewho grew his hair out\u003c/a\u003e with Brady during that glorious era. At that point, he was a (quality) special teamer and supplementary slot receiver that I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect to stick around long (despite \u003ca href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/E/EdelJu00.htm#:~:text=Draft%3A%20New%20England%20Patriots%20in,of%20the%202009%20NFL%20Draft.\"\u003ea strong rookie campaign\u003c/a\u003e in \u0026lsquo;09) given the Patriots\u0026rsquo; penchant for burning through players at that position. Fast forward to 2011, and the already-shaky secondary was losing guys to injury at an alarming pace. All the sudden, there was a white dude playing slot corner. Of course, it was Jules. He went on to play offense, defense and special teams for the Pats in that second Super Bowl we don\u0026rsquo;t talk about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NhW8agJn04c\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first, Edelman\u0026rsquo;s best ability was availability. Once Welker hit the bricks and the Pats brought in Danny Amendola to replace him, Edelman shopped around, wound up taking the one year prove-it deal from NE and blossomed. The Patriots DO NOT WIN Super Bowls 4, 5 and 6 without him. Amendola underwhelmed (considering his $28.5 million price tag) while Edelman over-performed (that prove-it deal was worth $765K), and allowed the Pats to expand on the Welker role. McDaniels could build out that route tree to suit New Wes, and as he aged, Brady retained a trusty safety valve to help him get rid of the ball quickly and pick up all-important 6-9 yard-chunks down the middle in years where offensive line and outside receiver depth was thin. That became even more important after Aaron Hernandez, yknow, and Gronk\u0026rsquo;s body began breaking down. He was the perfect slot receiver; shifty, fast and tough with a nose for space and a silky pair of hands. The man relished contact, a crucial trait for someone who was smeared more thoroughly and frequently than bugs on windshields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AGTLUVRR5vQ\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe man\u0026rsquo;s first instinct in this moment was to get up and keep running–an absolute sicko. Also, that was Kam Chancellor delivering the hit, one of the \u0026ldquo;most hardest hitting safeties in the league\u0026rdquo; and a man with 35 pounds and 5 inches on Jules\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStatistically, Edelman\u0026rsquo;s isn\u0026rsquo;t the most eye-popping \u003ca href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/E/EdelJu00.htm\"\u003ePro Football Reference page\u003c/a\u003e out there, but there are some interesting tidbits. The big one is the 2nd-most postseason receiving yards of all time with 1,442 (as well as a Super Bowl MVP trophy). Looking beyond that, his yards per reception percentage was above 10 in all but two of his 11 season–his rookie year, and a 2011 season where he only had six total receptions. From 2013-2019, he averaged over six receptions per game, only dipping below 50 receiving first downs in a season once across that same stretch. Like many Belichick finds, \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/N4bJiXjdKVs?t=164\"\u003ehe was a special teams ace\u003c/a\u003e–especially as a returner (2nd amongst active players in punt return TDs and yards per punt return at the time of his retirement). All that said, my favorite Edelman stats are from those playoff runs in 2014, 2016 and 2018. Final combined tally from those nine games: 1,011 yards on 73 receptions, 54 first downs, two TDs (though he also threw a passing TD in \u0026lsquo;14) and 112.3 yards per game. As Giselle famously told us, her husband cannot throw and catch the ball, so Tom\u0026rsquo;s bromance with Edelman existed for good reason. And then there was this catch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RRWl73-L3L0?start=164\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou could pick plenty of huge moments from that Super Bowl and make a compelling case for it being the tipping point, but emotionally, I submit this as \u003cem\u003ethe\u003c/em\u003e one. Belichick said this after the game, but the Patriots had been on the other side of that specific equation in each of their three most recent SB appearances (\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCAQsEwyCcg\"\u003eTyree\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cXqbqMgNoE\"\u003eManningham\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKOLqM-LnA0\"\u003eKearse\u003c/a\u003e). But this time, it was their emotional leader making the huge play. For Edelman to somehow come up with that ball, on the readjustment, bum pinky finger to boot, is something I can only chalk up to the nebulous concept of football karma. In a way, it brought \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT6XziIQ5RI\"\u003eWelker\u0026rsquo;s SB drop from 2012\u003c/a\u003e full circle. Four years after the original drop, one that would\u0026rsquo;ve probably clinched the game and was bungled by a man with some of the surest hands these eyes have seen, his \u0026ldquo;replacement\u0026rdquo; got his hands under a ball he never should\u0026rsquo;ve caught to keep a comeback that never should\u0026rsquo;ve happened alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlong those same lines, how do we define Edelman\u0026rsquo;s career? Let\u0026rsquo;s get one thing out of the way first–no, he is not a Hall of Famer. Pats HoF and a red jacket? Absolutely, but no gold and no Canton bust. Look at this year\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"https://www.profootballhof.com/15-modern-era-player-finalists-announced-for-hofs-class-of-2021/\"\u003eModern Era Finalists\u003c/a\u003e at wide receiver–it\u0026rsquo;s Calvin Johnson, Roddy White and Reggie Wayne. For all his greatness, Edelman is a solid tier or two below that bar. You\u0026rsquo;d be hard pressed to make the case for him over other 21st century guys like Andre Johnson, Steve Smith, Hines Ward, Torrey Holt, Anquan Boldin, even Ochocinco. Wes Welker himself also has a \u003ca href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/hof/hofm_WR.htm\"\u003estronger statistical case\u003c/a\u003e for the HoF. The \u003ca href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/E/EdelJu00.htm\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;similar players\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e chart is another fun Pro Football Reference tool, and the most similar career to Edelman\u0026rsquo;s from the 21st century would be that of one T.J. Houshmandzadeh. That seems about right to me–T.J. was another great, albeit different, player and a menace for AFC teams to deal with, but not an HoFer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zZj0SLJZlqA?start=164\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut all that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t, and probably doesn\u0026rsquo;t, matter to Pats fans. Edelman is one of several key supporting characters from the Brady-Belichick area that will be fondly remembered locally (with the charisma and nose for attention that makes it very unlikely he will allow you to forget him). I always enjoy drawing parallels between Boston athletes playing different sports, and the guy that immediately comes to mind for Edelman is Dustin Pedroia. To briefly expand, both were the \u0026ldquo;heart-and-soul\u0026rdquo; emotional leaders of their respective teams for good chunks of their careers; never the hands-down most talented player, but always the guy making the key play in the middle of the field, with extra effort, to win. Both got three rings and both had to retire before they were ready with injuries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Jules, thanks for the mems, the slants, the first downs and all the rest. I\u0026rsquo;ll definitely miss him zipping around the middle, settling into softs spots, eating hits from 250-pounders and delivering death-by-a-thousand-cuts to teams from Seattle to New York and everywhere in between. It\u0026rsquo;s a shame he couldn\u0026rsquo;t go out on his own terms, but other than that, he left no box unchecked. He was the ultimate overachiever in all the best ways, and he\u0026rsquo;ll always be well-remembered and well-loved in New England.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mfZBwM61FHs?start=164\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e"

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI wrote a different version of this blog after Week 13, when the Pats sat at 6-6. Unlike the real sports journos of yore, I did not make a promise to \u003ca href=\"https://www.tallahassee.com/story/life/2015/03/19/portrait-past-columnist-eats-column/25017671/?showmenu=true\"\u003eeat my own column \u003c/a\u003eshould my sage predictions be proven wrong. I also didn’t get it published in time. Or anywhere, for that matter. And yet here we are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn any case, that version was quite a bit different. It started off with something about going 4-2 down the stretch and deteriorated from there. I’ll spare you the details, but please know it came from a part of my brain that still thought the dynasty was alive. And I’m glad it never saw the light of day because you might confuse me for a Pats fanboy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am a card-carrying Pats fanboy still a bit hungover from the glory of my childhood/teenage year/college years, but this season was a slow motion kick to the bits. I imagine most Pats fans agree. It’s long overdue in the grand scheme of things; I loosely equate it to last year’s Warriors team minus the top 2 pick at the end of the shitbow. FWIW, our reign of terror was much longer anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/1ZDoc9v1mWOUNIxLWh\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowFullScreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/espn-steph-curry-in-the-zone-zoned-out-1ZDoc9v1mWOUNIxLWh\"\u003evia GIPHY\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny Pats fan with a brain stem had lower expectations for this season. Sure, you said they’d win the division after Cam Newton signed, but you weren’t alone (regionally). No matter how sweet his black-and-white offseason training videos looked, reality was bound to set in. The man had to replace the greatest QB of all time, during a global pandemic, after his new team \u003ca href=\"https://www.patspulpit.com/2021/2/5/22268660/devin-mccourty-believes-new-england-patriots-opt-outs-are-trending-towards-returning-for-2021#:~:text=An%20NFL%2Dhigh%20eight%20New,offensive%20side%20of%20the%20ball.\"\u003elogged the most opt-outs in the NFL\u003c/a\u003e, and with \u003ca href=\"https://www.lineups.com/nfl/depth-charts/new-england-patriots\"\u003ea receiving/tight end corps\u003c/a\u003e that was, uh, thin at best and useless at worst (hi N’Keal!). You can’t be \u003cem\u003ethat\u003c/em\u003e surprised the offense had severe growing pains; a QB/coach duo creates a system with the same coordinator and runs it to perfection for 10+ years. It stands to reason 1 A.T. (After Tom) would be tough. Cam never got the time or prep he needed, and his body was never right. Add in his pass catchers, COVID, canceled bye week, you catch my drift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Pats lost some games they shouldn’t have in 2020, but \u003ca href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/gwd_career.htm\"\u003ethey won a lot of games (big games) they shouldn’t have\u003c/a\u003e over the past two-ish decades. It was to be expected, really; remove Tom Brady from the equation, watch that win percentage in those games dip. Some of them were maddening–the Cam stuff vs. SEA and Cam fumble vs. BUF stand out–but that is what we’ve watched other fanbases deal with for years. In hindsight, this was a pretty good preview.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/41Y7OYLNR38\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut to me, the Patriots were entertaining, even when they lost. I respect the limited amount of blowouts, the commitment to lingering just long enough to make me watch the 4th quarter and the newfound ability to shoot themselves in the foot in key situations. We even got to play the “In the Hunt” game for a couple weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as a Pats fan, you can’t be that mad. You took a shot on a former MVP for a bargain, and even though he didn\u0026rsquo;t hit his stride, you never heard a bad thing about Cam from the locker room or media. Bill’s still there, Josh is still there (for now), and a cohort of Belichick sons and former linebackers should have the defense covered. Sony Michel and Damien Harris ought to be an above-average backfield tandem for the next few years. They found enough low-ceiling, high-effort guys to plug the gaps and keep things vaguely interesting. I\u0026rsquo;m sure Jakobi Meyers earned another look. We were also introduced to a couple keepers on defense–Josh Uche and Kyle Dugger most notably. The O-line did a bang-up job, especially considering it was pretty easy to plan for a run-based attack. Special teams were stellar, per usual (shoutout to Jake Bailey and the old man Nick Folk).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ptwJIyZHLo4\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlenty of disappointments too. Receivers and tight ends, obviously, but no Edelman hurt. N’Keal Harry continuing the trend of \u003ca href=\"https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/patriots/how-many-patriots-wide-receiver-draft-picks-have-actually-worked-out\"\u003ecrappy 2010s receiver draft picks\u003c/a\u003e wasn’t pleasant, and the same could be said about the extremely noticeable lack of production from a tight end group that\u0026rsquo;s typically a point of emphasis. The defense couldn’t knuckle down consistently enough when they needed stops, especially against the run. But most obvious, at least to the casual eye, were the screwups in key situations–turnovers, penalties, can’t-get-a-key-stop, stalled drives. It’s not to say they didn’t catch their share of breaks or didn’t make ANY clutch plays. It was just a striking difference–especially when you built a dynasty on winning those pivotal moments of football games–to continue finding your team on the other side of that equation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/J9UqUAXLDjc?start=443\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut again, nothing more than a mild air of disappointment from me on this Pats season. The playoffs were still compelling, with plenty of juicy storylines for Pats fans. A quick rundown: the Big Ben era is over in Pittsburgh (he resigned, I know, but c\u0026rsquo;mon), Buffalo taking up the mantle for the AFC East, everyone caught up with John Harbaugh again. Even the ones with no loose connection were fun: Browns won a game! Extra wild card teams! One bye! Crying Drew Brees! COVID hanging over everything! Patty Mahomes isn\u0026rsquo;t worth his contract (he is)! The NFC was never actually that good! Oh, and the old man got his 7th.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://gifer.com/embed/2vuz\" width=480 height=248.727 frameBorder=\"0\" allowFullScreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://gifer.com\"\u003evia GIFER\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eOnly one ring!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePats fans, I hope you enjoyed some playoff football with no deeply personal, unnecessarily weighty emotions riding on it. Throw on a championship DVD if you’re feeling down about your team–there’s six to choose from. And look forward to next year; Bill will have his last laugh, one way or another. It might not be next year, but history suggests you might want to stick around and find out.\u003c/p\u003e\n"
