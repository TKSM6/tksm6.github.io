            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI wrote a different version of this blog after Week 13, when the Pats sat at 6-6. Unlike the real sports journos of yore, I did not make a promise to \u003ca href=\"https://www.tallahassee.com/story/life/2015/03/19/portrait-past-columnist-eats-column/25017671/?showmenu=true\"\u003eeat my own column \u003c/a\u003eshould my sage predictions be proven wrong. I also didn’t get it published in time. Or anywhere, for that matter. And yet here we are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn any case, that version was quite a bit different. It started off with something about going 4-2 down the stretch and deteriorated from there. I’ll spare you the details, but please know it came from a part of my brain that still thought the dynasty was alive. And I’m glad it never saw the light of day because you might confuse me for a Pats fanboy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am a card-carrying Pats fanboy still a bit hungover from the glory of my childhood/teenage year/college years, but this season was a slow motion kick to the bits. I imagine most Pats fans agree. It’s long overdue in the grand scheme of things; I loosely equate it to last year’s Warriors team minus the top 2 pick at the end of the shitbow. FWIW, our reign of terror was much longer anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/1ZDoc9v1mWOUNIxLWh\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowFullScreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/espn-steph-curry-in-the-zone-zoned-out-1ZDoc9v1mWOUNIxLWh\"\u003evia GIPHY\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny Pats fan with a brain stem had lower expectations for this season. Sure, you said they’d win the division after Cam Newton signed, but you weren’t alone (regionally). No matter how sweet his black-and-white offseason training videos looked, reality was bound to set in. The man had to replace the greatest QB of all time, during a global pandemic, after his new team \u003ca href=\"https://www.patspulpit.com/2021/2/5/22268660/devin-mccourty-believes-new-england-patriots-opt-outs-are-trending-towards-returning-for-2021#:~:text=An%20NFL%2Dhigh%20eight%20New,offensive%20side%20of%20the%20ball.\"\u003elogged the most opt-outs in the NFL\u003c/a\u003e, and with \u003ca href=\"https://www.lineups.com/nfl/depth-charts/new-england-patriots\"\u003ea receiving/tight end corps\u003c/a\u003e that was, uh, thin at best and useless at worst (hi N’Keal!). You can’t be \u003cem\u003ethat\u003c/em\u003e surprised the offense had severe growing pains; a QB/coach duo creates a system with the same coordinator and runs it to perfection for 10+ years. It stands to reason 1 A.T. (After Tom) would be tough. Cam never got the time or prep he needed, and his body was never right. Add in his pass catchers, COVID, canceled bye week, you catch my drift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Pats lost some games they shouldn’t have in 2020, but \u003ca href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/gwd_career.htm\"\u003ethey won a lot of games (big games) they shouldn’t have\u003c/a\u003e over the past two-ish decades. It was to be expected, really; remove Tom Brady from the equation, watch that win percentage in those games dip. Some of them were maddening–the Cam stuff vs. SEA and Cam fumble vs. BUF stand out–but that is what we’ve watched other fanbases deal with for years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/41Y7OYLNR38\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut to me, the Patriots were entertaining, even when they lost. I respect the limited amount of blowouts, the commitment to lingering just long enough to make me watch the 4th quarter and the newfound ability to shoot themselves in the foot in key situations. We even got to play the “In the Hunt” game for a couple weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as a Pats fan, you can’t be that mad. You took a shot on a former MVP for a bargain, and even though he didn\u0026rsquo;t hit his stride, you never heard a bad thing about Cam from the locker room or media. Bill’s still there, Josh is still there (for now), and a cohort of Belichick sons and former linebackers should have the defense covered. Sony Michel and Damien Harris ought to be an above-average backfield tandem for the next few years. They found enough low-ceiling, high-effort guys to plug the gaps and keep things vaguely interesting. I\u0026rsquo;m sure Jakobi Meyers and Damiere Byrd earned another look. We were also introduced to a couple keepers on defense–Josh Uche and Kyle Dugger most notably. The O-line did a bang-up job, especially considering it was pretty easy to plan for a run-based attack. Special teams were stellar, per usual (shoutout to Jake Bailey and the old man Nick Folk).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlenty of disappointments too. Receivers and tight ends, obviously, but no Edelman hurt. N’Keal Harry continuing the trend of crappy Day 1 receiver picks wasn’t pleasant, and the same could be said about the lack of production from the tight end position. The defense couldn’t knuckle down consistently enough when they needed stops, especially against the run. But most obvious, at least to the casual eye, were the screwups in key situations–turnovers, penalties, can’t-get-a-key-stop, stalled drives. It’s not to say they didn’t catch their share of breaks or didn’t make ANY clutch plays. It was just a striking difference–especially when you built a dynasty on winning those pivotal moments of football games–to continue finding your team on the other side of that equation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut again, nothing more than a mild air of disappointment from me on this Pats season. The playoffs were still compelling, with plenty of juicy storylines for Pats fans. A quick rundown: the Big Ben era is over in Pittsburgh (he resigned, I know, but c\u0026rsquo;mon), Buffalo taking up the mantle for the AFC East, everyone caught up with John Harbaugh again. Even the ones with no loose connection were fun: Browns won a game! Extra wild card teams! One bye! Crying Drew Brees! COVID hanging over everything! Patty Mahomes isn\u0026rsquo;t worth his contract (he is)! The NFC was never actually that good! Oh, and the old man got his 7th.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePats fans, I hope you enjoyed some playoff football with no deeply personal, unnecessarily weighty emotions riding on it. Throw on a championship DVD if you’re feeling down about your team–there’s six to choose from. And look forward to next year; Bill will have his last laugh, one way or another. It might not be next year, but history suggests you might want to stick around and find out.\u003c/p\u003e\n"
