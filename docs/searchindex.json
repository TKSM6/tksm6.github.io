[{"content":"Editor\u0026rsquo;s Note: If he runs down to Tampa Bay to play with his old buddies, I\u0026rsquo;ll be sick. I\u0026rsquo;m mentally prepared for the news to break sometime this summer, but until then, nothing but happy thoughts.\nThe top story out of Foxborough last week was Julian Edelman\u0026rsquo;s retirement, and I am sad. Not for him–his knee is shot, he made his money and I\u0026rsquo;d suspect he\u0026rsquo;s got a bright life after football waiting for him in front of whatever camera he chooses. We saw the wheels falling off a bit last season; anytime an older player attempts, and then aborts, a comeback from a tough injury, there\u0026rsquo;s probably a reason why. But doling out flowers to those who deserve them is never a bad idea, and I\u0026rsquo;d like to do so for Jules.\n As a fan, I first knew Edelman as knockoff Wes Welker, then the other guy who grew his hair out with Brady during that glorious era. At that point, he was a (quality) special teamer and supplementary slot receiver that I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect to stick around long (despite a strong rookie campaign in \u0026lsquo;09) given the Patriots\u0026rsquo; penchant for burning through players at that position. Fast forward to 2011, and the already-shaky secondary was losing guys to injury at an alarming pace. All the sudden, there was a white dude playing slot corner. Of course, it was Jules. He went on to play offense, defense and special teams for the Pats in that second Super Bowl we don\u0026rsquo;t talk about.\n At first, Edelman\u0026rsquo;s best ability was availability. Once Welker hit the bricks and the Pats brought in Danny Amendola to replace him, Edelman shopped around, wound up taking the one year prove-it deal from NE and blossomed. The Patriots DO NOT WIN Super Bowls 4, 5 and 6 without him. Amendola underwhelmed (considering his $28.5 million price tag) while Edelman over-performed (that prove-it deal was worth $765K), and allowed the Pats to expand on the Welker role. McDaniels could build out that route tree to suit New Wes, and as he aged, Brady retained a trusty safety valve to help him get rid of the ball quickly and pick up all-important 6-9 yard-chunks down the middle in years where offensive line and outside receiver depth was thin. That became even more important after Aaron Hernandez, yknow, and Gronk\u0026rsquo;s body began breaking down. He was the perfect slot receiver; shifty, fast and tough with a nose for space and a silky pair of hands. The man relished contact, a crucial trait for someone who was smeared more thoroughly and frequently than bugs on windshields.\n The man\u0026rsquo;s first instinct in this moment was to get up and keep running–an absolute sicko. Also, that was Kam Chancellor delivering the hit, one of the \u0026ldquo;most hardest hitting safeties in the league\u0026rdquo; and a man with 35 pounds and 5 inches on Jules\nStatistically, Edelman\u0026rsquo;s isn\u0026rsquo;t the most eye-popping Pro Football Reference page out there, but there are some interesting tidbits. The big one is the 2nd-most postseason receiving yards of all time with 1,442 (as well as a Super Bowl MVP trophy). Looking beyond that, his yards per reception percentage was above 10 in all but two of his 11 season–his rookie year, and a 2011 season where he only had six total receptions. From 2013-2019, he averaged over six receptions per game, only dipping below 50 receiving first downs in a season once across that same stretch. Like many Belichick finds, he was a special teams ace–especially as a returner (2nd amongst active players in punt return TDs and yards per punt return at the time of his retirement). All that said, my favorite Edelman stats are from those playoff runs in 2014, 2016 and 2018. Final combined tally from those nine games: 1,011 yards on 73 receptions, 54 first downs, two TDs (though he also threw a passing TD in \u0026lsquo;14) and 112.3 yards per game. As Giselle famously told us, her husband cannot throw and catch the ball, so Tom\u0026rsquo;s bromance with Edelman existed for good reason. And then there was this catch.\n You could pick plenty of huge moments from that Super Bowl and make a compelling case for it being the tipping point, but emotionally, I submit this as the one. Belichick said this after the game, but the Patriots had been on the other side of that specific equation in each of their three most recent SB appearances (Tyree, Manningham, Kearse). But this time, it was their emotional leader making the huge play. For Edelman to somehow come up with that ball, on the readjustment, bum pinky finger to boot, is something I can only chalk up to the nebulous concept of football karma. In a way, it brought Welker\u0026rsquo;s SB drop from 2012 full circle. Four years after the original drop, one that would\u0026rsquo;ve probably clinched the game and was bungled by a man with some of the surest hands these eyes have seen, his \u0026ldquo;replacement\u0026rdquo; got his hands under a ball he never should\u0026rsquo;ve caught to keep a comeback that never should\u0026rsquo;ve happened alive.\nAlong those same lines, how do we define Edelman\u0026rsquo;s career? Let\u0026rsquo;s get one thing out of the way first–no, he is not a Hall of Famer. Pats HoF and a red jacket? Absolutely, but no gold and no Canton bust. Look at this year\u0026rsquo;s Modern Era Finalists at wide receiver–it\u0026rsquo;s Calvin Johnson, Roddy White and Reggie Wayne. For all his greatness, Edelman is a solid tier or two below that bar. You\u0026rsquo;d be hard pressed to make the case for him over other 21st century guys like Andre Johnson, Steve Smith, Hines Ward, Torrey Holt, Anquan Boldin, even Ochocinco. Wes Welker himself also has a stronger statistical case for the HoF. The \u0026ldquo;similar players\u0026rdquo; chart is another fun Pro Football Reference tool, and the most similar career to Edelman\u0026rsquo;s from the 21st century would be that of one T.J. Houshmandzadeh. That seems about right to me–T.J. was another great, albeit different, player and a menace for AFC teams to deal with, but not an HoFer.\n But all that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t, and probably doesn\u0026rsquo;t, matter to Pats fans. Edelman is one of several key supporting characters from the Brady-Belichick area that will be fondly remembered locally (with the charisma and nose for attention that makes it very unlikely he will allow you to forget him). I always enjoy drawing parallels between Boston athletes playing different sports, and the guy that immediately comes to mind for Edelman is Dustin Pedroia. To briefly expand, both were the \u0026ldquo;heart-and-soul\u0026rdquo; emotional leaders of their respective teams for good chunks of their careers; never the hands-down most talented player, but always the guy making the key play in the middle of the field, with extra effort, to win. Both got three rings and both had to retire before they were ready with injuries.\nSo Jules, thanks for the mems, the slants, the first downs and all the rest. I\u0026rsquo;ll definitely miss him zipping around the middle, settling into softs spots, eating hits from 250-pounders and delivering death-by-a-thousand-cuts to teams from Seattle to New York and everywhere in between. It\u0026rsquo;s a shame he couldn\u0026rsquo;t go out on his own terms, but other than that, he left no box unchecked. He was the ultimate overachiever in all the best ways, and he\u0026rsquo;ll always be well-remembered and well-loved in New England.\n","date":"15 April, 2021","id":0,"permalink":"/massholery/goodnight-sweet-jules/","summary":"Editor\u0026rsquo;s Note: If he runs down to Tampa Bay to play with his old buddies, I\u0026rsquo;ll be sick.

Don’t worry, chest-beating Americans, it’s a secondary thought stuffed somewhere behind blowing up colorful explosives in honor of our nation’s birth and drinking heavily regardless of the hour or day of the week.\nTour De France GIF from Tourdefrance GIFs Now, the next logical question would be why watch the Tour? On paper, it’s a competition between a large field of rail-thin men peddling bikes–yes, bicycles–across the country of France for hundreds of miles a day over 21 stages to see who can do it in the least amount of time. Snooze.\nHowever, the Tour de France represents some of the best sports programming on your television this summer (and every summer) because it\u0026rsquo;s one the toughest tests of human endurance known to man. Add in men riding top-of-the-line, multi-thousand dollar racing bicycles at speeds ranging from 5 mph to 60 mph mere inches from each other’s wheels in packs often exceeding 100 riders for anywhere from an hour to six hours at a time.\n Still no? Well, for us Americans, we like cheering for teams. They are easier to cheer for than individual players, and all you have to do is locate the nearest metropolis to find your allegiances. But some folks do like cheering for individuals; perhaps a bright young star on a team you don’t like or a former fan favorite traded away for cap space and players-to-be-named-later. Lucky for you, America, the Tour de France offers you the opportunity to do both.\nThis year [2019], 22 teams took to the roads of France for the Tour. If you wanted to cheer along national lines, the Colorado-based Education First team is your choice. If you like frontrunners, the powerhouse Team Ineos is your side [they won]. If you want to ride the long-suffering French cycling bandwagon (the last French winner of the Tour won the event in 1985), then the AG2R La Mondiale squad fits the bill. If you harbor a passion for Spanish telephone companies, then the Movistar outfit is for you.\n This is Chris Froome, one of the best cyclists of the 2010s and a four-time TDF winner.\nThough the teams compete against each other to get the most riders across the line the fastest, the main attraction is the race for the yellow jersey, worn each stage by the rider with the lowest overall time. Each eight-man cohort features a team leader, the man with the best shot at a stage win or a high finish in the overall classification. Though Americans cycling fans are still waiting patiently for an elite rider of that caliber to fill the void left by you-know-who, there are a bevy of top-tier potential winners to get behind. Even if all the digital ink I’ve wasted hasn’t gotten you any closer to finding your team or rider, perhaps I can convince you to tune in for a stage and find one.\nvia GIPHY\nAs mentioned, the race for the yellow jersey occupies center stage for good reason. The logistical nightmares associated with winning the Tour de France is precisely why the handful of riders that compete annually for yellow create such a captivating sporting event. To win the Tour, you must BEGIN the race with the following items; a team talented, healthy and deep enough to guide you to the finish, peak physical condition unaffected by illness, injury or fatigue from training and warm-up races, and a team infrastructure developed and efficient enough to keep your equipment intact and your body operating for the entire three weeks. Once the race begins, you must avoid injury and illness at all costs. Your teammates must also avoid injury and illness at all costs, as a depleted squad cannot protect and guide their captain to the finish line. Crashes happen nearly every stage, and staying on your bike is imperative to winning the Tour. You must account for the other riders gunning for the yellow jersey, marking their movements and countering their attacks to prevent too much time from slipping away. You must push your body to its physical limits for multiple hours and hundreds of miles every day for three weeks straight. Most important of all, you need a healthy dose of luck. An ill-timed flat tire, a spectator stumbling into the road, bad road conditions, mistakes by other riders leading to field crashes, cobblestones, wind, heat, food poisoning, a bad day on the bike and more can all derail a yellow jersey campaign in an instant.\n If the long slog doesn’t wet your whistle, consider the three other jerseys awarded at the conclusion of the Tour. The green jersey goes to the best sprinter, the riders who don’t have the endurance to win the big show but represent a who’s-who of cycling’s fastest, most powerful drag racers. Nowadays, that jersey is perennially on the shoulder’s of the most interesting (bike racing) man in the world, Peter Sagan. The strategy, speed (usually a shade over 40 mph) and skill required for an effective sprint finish are reason enough to pay attention to the green jersey competition. For fans of endurance, the polka-dot jersey adorns the shoulders of the man who performs the best in the notoriously difficult mountain stages of the Tour. For Rookie of the Year lovers, the white jersey goes to the young (25 and under) rider who turns in the best time. In addition, each stage features its own hotly-contested search for a winner. For the majority of team riders, a stage win is their best hope for a moment of notoriety. This results in heroic performances from unheralded riders pulling themselves inside out for an afternoon in the spotlight, battling with top general classification contenders, sprinters, mountain specialists and other “role players” taking a crack at a stage win.\n It’s tough to condense why you should watch the Tour de France down to a single reason or factor, so allow me to replay the hits. There’s plenty of avenues to fandom, whether it be for a team, an individual rider, underdogs, front runners, sprinters, mountain climbers, etc. Each day features, in one way or another, a special ride from the stage winner that is an inconceivable physical effort for ~99% of the world’s population. Each classification winner would be worth watching on their own, but they compete against and alongside each other for three weeks. There’s speed, danger, crashes, redemption stories, upstarts, underdogs, powerhouses and, most importantly, elite athletes at the peak of their abilities dueling with just their bodies and a bicycle across the mountains, plains, towns and cities of one of the most beautiful countries in the world. Even though there’s no balls, goals, fields, cheerleaders, hitting or tackling (plenty of contact though!), the man-and-his-machine nature of the race lends the Tour something American team sports lack. Not to get too prehistoric, but I contend it’s the idea of pushing the human body to its limits in direct competition with your fellow man that makes the race so appealing and entertaining. Even if you disagree, it might be a nice change of pace from a baseball game.\n","date":"12 April, 2021","id":1,"permalink":"/sports-and-games/why-i-love-the-tour-de-france/","summary":"I wrote this a couple years back, so modern-day editor\u0026rsquo;s notes will be italicized\nIt’s very un-American of me to associate the 4th of July with the start of the Tour de France, but I do.

I’ve been kicking a list around in my head for quite some time, but it’s time to make it official. I’ll be leaving out the U.S. versions since I didn’t watch all of it and what I saw disgusted me. I know people like that; it hits too close to home. The Aussies were generally too chill to achieve peak villainy but still had their moments. But those damned Brits, stuck on their rainy little island, unsurprisingly dredged up some horrible people over six series.\nIt’s important to note seasons 1 and 2 were in another league when it comes to toxicity. This was before the show really hit it big and producers let more fly, such as on-camera sex, unlimited drinks, cartons of cigs, etc. From season 3 on, it mostly turned into an influencer convention with less MA-rated content, smoking and drinking. It also became more tame–and rightfully so–as former islanders spoke out on how their mental health suffered in that environment. There\u0026rsquo;s been a lot written and said about how lacking Love Island is with their post-show mental health care, so while this list is all in good fun, it\u0026rsquo;s important to acknowledge when people who\u0026rsquo;ve shown more of themselves on international TV than 99.9% of us ever will (comes with the territory, granted) are not being properly cared for after the fact.\n What does it take to become a villain on a show like this? For me, it comes down to a couple things. Emotional immaturity almost always plays a factor. Liars are the worst. Cockiness and insecurity often lead to shadiness. Stupidity always works against these people. But the manipulators are the worst–the ones who gaslight, emotionally bankrupt their partners, play mind games and are ruthlessly self-centered. So without any further ado, let’s go.\nHonorable Mentions\nEden (Australia Season 1)\nvia GIPHY\nThis short-tempered, emotionally stunted prison guard stuck with his partner Erin from day 1 and eventually finished second. Along the way, he shouted down Tayla, tried to fight a smaller man, pissed and moaned constantly and was generally a brat. He and Erin split after she said the relationship became abusive; he denies it, but where there\u0026rsquo;s this sort of smoke, there\u0026rsquo;s usually fire. Eden claims Erin painted him as an “aggressive, angry, threatening person” and that he isn’t really that guy. I’d like to let Eden know that’s exactly how he came across on the show.\nJavi (Season 2)\nvia GIPHY\nI’m sure he’d be on the real list had he stuck around any longer, but this desperate little worm was first man voted off that season. I actually liked how, at first, he would get in the confessional and speak his mind, but then there’s the matter of what was on his mind. He was, hands-down, one of the most toxic dudes on the show.\n Naomi (Season 1): An ice queen in the classic sense, Naomi wrapped her younger partner Josh (a full-blown douche in his own right) so tightly around her finger it killed what few brain cells he had left. He stood no chance, but Naomi got greedy, got caught in a few lies and fans and islanders alike turned on her. All she really did was go after other girls’ guys, lead Josh on and lie (small potatoes in the villa), but because she did it with her nose in the air, it rubbed everyone the wrong way.\n*It\u0026rsquo;s damn near impossible to find any video of her, or any real video, from Season 1.\nEyal (Season 4)\nvia GIPHY\nThis guy was less of a villain and more an insufferable, pseudo-spiritual douche. He’s the guy that went to a couple therapy sessions and figured out how to sound emotionally mature while still behaving like a middle schooler. Lucky for him, he got mad at the nicest dude on the show (Dr. Alex) for going after a girl he was interested in after Eyal…did that exact thing to Alex days before. He showed his true colors–insecure, mostly–the second he got pressed and was gone not longer after. He also acted like a weirdo the whole time.\n Now, for the main course\u0026hellip;\nGeorgia (Season 4)\nvia GIPHY\nI think Georgia was 20 when she showed up on the island, and you could tell. It wasn’t even original–there was a nastier, crazier version of Georgia (the next entrant on this list) on a previous season. She was smart enough to know how to get what she wanted, but too petulant to know how to act when she didn’t. Her #1 catchphrase was loyalty, and her M.O. was treating everyone like crap. It was a classic example of demanding what you don’t offer in return. She threw fits, popped off at people, couldn’t handle a drink and instigated, but she found her man in Sam. She convinced him to leave the villa with her so she could…cheat on him with her ex and then lie/gaslight Sam about it during the Christmas reunion. She also kissed a guy on a date while still in the villa before flat-out lying about it in front of everyone. She stuck around long enough to make a serious impression and have an argument with nearly everyone, so she makes the cut over the other HMs.\n Kady (Season 2)\nvia GIPHY\nThe original Georgia from season 2, Kady was also a liar, but her brand was emotional manipulation. Like Georgia, Kady was 20 when she showed up on the show and took a shine to an older man (in this case Scott). Though he was far from faultless in their constant fighting, Kady provoked most of it. She played his insecurities to her advantage and then swooped in to keep stringing him along before Scott could cobble together enough brain cells to realize she was making him happy AND miserable (or decide to leave her). She LOVED to argue and pick fights–mostly with Scott, but anyone could catch those hands. The defining moment was her having a full-blown meltdown when a new girl came in and invited Scott out on a date, as is often custom. Nothing happened, but she called the girl some nasty names and told Scott what he could go do with himself (mind you, bro had no say in any of this). Meanwhile, Kady had done a bit of flirting, dating and rubbernecking of her own while still “with” Scott. It\u0026rsquo;s one of the most crystal-clear example of unabashed hypocrisy on a show full of hypocrites, and Kady is probably the reason they continue casting 20/21-year-olds–they stir the pot.\n The Alberti Twins (Season 1)- These guys were just huge tools, not much else too it. They were too stupid to lie their way in, and they had two cracks at it. All the while, the twins were talking prodigious amounts of sh*t about how they were “real men” with money and the whole situation were beneath them. They were extremely rude to all the women and had excuses galore for all of it. Facially, they were some of the ugliest dudes that have ever been on the show, pulled up in matching suits like the herbs they were and called themselves the Italian Stallions despite being painfully British. They were unwatchable; I have no idea why they came back for a second round of dinner dates at the end when it was clear everyone already hated them. I guess they needed huge villains for Season 1 and found them, but seriously, there was not a single redeemable moment or quality for either of them.\n *There isn\u0026rsquo;t much video on YouTube to help me illustrate my point, but I\u0026rsquo;m not wrong. Go look on Reddit if you really care, but their cookbook is called \u0026ldquo;Twintastico.\u0026rdquo; That should be enough info.\nJonny (Season 3)\nvia GIPHY\nA literal man baby, but the kind that’s lived enough life to think they have all the answers. Jonny wormed his way in with Camila (the humanitarian ordinance disposal worker who deserved so much better than this show) by playing up how cultured he was. For him, that mostly just meant he got a lot of money and used it as an excuse to be a prick. Camila figured it out pretty early and took a step back after Jonny offered a detailed explanation on why he doesn’t believe in feminism (after she correctly defined it for him) or think work conditions are unfair for modern women. But his masterpiece was how he perfectly he proved her right after the fact. Jonny ended up hitting the destruct button on him and Camila instead of trying to learn, listen, be better, etc. He did so because a younger woman caught his eye. He said he did it because he wanted things to go faster, wanted more excitement and, in his words, felt like he could be more himself around her. “Be himself,” of course, meaning be a moody, dour, sexist, boring, condescending, stupid loser. Then Theo showed up, expressed interest in Tyla and turned Jonny into a puddle. Being cocky, Theo noticed this and immediately provoked Jonny, exposing the hairy doof as hugely insecure and an enormous fake tough guy. All Jonny did was bitch about Theo, bitch about Tyla, smoke cigs and look way softer than everyone else. He wins, by a mile.\n","date":"7 April, 2021","id":2,"permalink":"/rants-and-stories/top-5-villains-love-island-uk/","summary":"Ohhhhhh BABY I’ve been waiting for this one.

The game itself? Boring and long. The players? Too far away, and usually not pros. Other fans? Drunk, sweaty, uninteresting. Gift shop? Mom says no, Dad says ask Mom. All those things I appreciate now, but they are tough to sell on an 8-year-old (except the gift shop). Still, by that point I knew how to catch a baseball. I knew they sometimes ended up in the stands during the game. And most importantly, I knew I wanted one.\nIt took me some time to make it happen. None of my early trips to Fenway Park yielded any luck, mostly because we were stuffed deep in right field, many rows up from the Pesky Pole. Older me would come to know that as a tough spot to hit a baseball. None of my trips to Fenway ever ended with a ball in hand, even after I swapped out the glove for a beer. To be fair, I only went to three or four during that time (the “bring your glove” era) and never had the favorable foul ball seats. But because I was so keen to catch one, I ended up glued to the game action and begging to stay until the last pitch.\n With Fenway and the MLB a lost cause, I moved down to AAA. Keeping it within the Red Sox organization, my family made several trips down to Pawtucket, RI to watch the Paw Sox. The team was good and tickets were cheap–the ideal summer outing for the whole fam. The park, on the other hand, was ugly and plopped into a random sector of the city. Minor league baseball is supposed to be a bit quaint, a bit old-timey, and that may be true throughout the lower levels (AA, A, etc.). But because the Paw Sox had the money and Rhode Island has no pro sports, they gave it all the ugly updates the early 21st century had to offer. For us, that meant a below-average stadium that was always scorching hot and lacking shade with oddly steep banked seating ringing the infield. Better seats and a smaller stadium made no difference, and I was routinely skunked. We did one a summer for about four years, and all I had to show for it were sunburns and those little plastic helmets they use as ice cream bowls.\nBut the drought soon ended as I climbed further down the ladder. The Cape Cod Baseball League is the premier destination for…top collegiate players to keep their skills sharp playing summer ball. There’s something funny to me about a bunch of kids who grew up in the South and play for SEC schools scooping ice cream and living in the least Southern place in the world–Cape Cod. There’s only one team that isn’t physically on the Cape, and that’s the team closest to me. The Wareham Gatemen play behind the town’s public high school–a big high school, but a high school nonetheless. Their field was what you’d expect; two banks of wooden bleachers for the home fans, one bank for the visitors on the other side, a small announcer’s box behind the plate, merch table, snack shack and little else. Aside from the visiting bullpen cut into the side of a hill in left field, the most notable feature was the infield. Instead of regular brown dirt, Spillane Field sports some kind of gravelly grey mixture masquerading as dirt.\n Weird hot dog eating aside, this is a pretty good lay of the land at Spillane Field\nAside from the bleachers flanking home plate, the rest of the area surrounding the field was open. The school ended up blocking much of the third base side, but you could run up and down the corridor between building and field. Down the first base side was nothing but grass and woods. The games were free to attend, so we went a lot. By this point, I needed a foul ball badly. So badly, in fact, that when one started bouncing my way down the aforementioned corridor, I body-checked a younger, smaller child into the side of the school to get my hands on it. Unluckily, his dad watched me do it. In my mind, I got there first, but the guy seemed mad. I gave the kid the ball, didn’t apologize and walked away.\nvia GIPHY\nThat underlines the issue with foul ball hunting at CCBL games; the pack of kids doing exactly the same thing. There was always a gaggle of children of various ages running around in the woods, parking lot and standing areas hunting baseballs. It got nasty on occasion; my hip check was a minor offense in comparison. Wrestling for foul balls in the grass was commonplace. But after watching and running and failing for years, I got my shot.\nIt was a during a night game, but the sun was still high enough to allow for chases into the woods. I was lingering near the press box behind home plate, hoping for a player to pop a ball backwards into my lap. Soon enough, I heard the aluminum ping and watched a ball flying foul out to the right, well over the stands and into the woods. Charging around the batting cages and towards the woods with my little sister right behind me, I thought I was too late. Half a dozen kids were already picking through the brush. Still, I dove in there after them. Prickers nipped at my shins as I stomped around, hoping to feel the ball under my feet. Suddenly, a glimpse of something white. I shot my hand out at the object, feeling the familiar seams and leathery exterior as I closed my fingers around it. I didn’t yell or celebrate; just a quick “I got it!” to call off the hunters and to claim my long-awaited prize.\nAll things considered, fishing a ball out of the woods at a college summer ball game played in front of 400 people is about as unimpressive as it gets. But at the time, I couldn’t have been prouder. Something I fixated on for years came to pass, and it was all because of me. I found the ball in the woods, which in my kid brain meant I was the best and a winner. As I got older, I came to the unfortunate realization that foul balls are worthless (and that I am not the best, or a winner). As far as I know, only Foul Ball Guy has managed a living catching them. And yet, adults will fling themselves down three rows of seats just to get a whiff. I contend that’s their kid brain waking up, remembering how excited it used to get in these moments and just shoving the adult brain out of the way so the actual adult can shove children out of the way. The older you get, chasing foul balls becomes harder to justify.

He\u0026rsquo;s having enough fun dealing with the trolls and their ilk on his own anyway. But because these people are such hypocrites, I simply must call it like I see it.\n Being a cornball, I enjoy \u0026ldquo;Panini\u0026rdquo;\nThe appetizer here is Kristi Noem, the brain-dead, gun-toting governor of South Dakota. If you\u0026rsquo;re wondering what kind of politician she is, she spent last week expanding gun rights in the wake of two mass shootings and this week cooking up an executive order to bar transgender athletes from participating in K-12 girls sports. Her reasoning was to \u0026ldquo;ensure equality,\u0026rdquo; which she did with a bill codifying inequality for an already-marginalized community. But on the Lord\u0026rsquo;s Day, someone introduced her to Lil Nas X. Knowing in her heart what the orange man would want her to say, she fired off this snappy little number.\nOur kids are being told that this kind of product is, not only okay, it's \"exclusive.\" But do you know what's more exclusive? Their God-given eternal soul.\nWe are in a fight for the soul of our nation. We need to fight hard. And we need to fight smart. We have to win. https://t.co/m1k1YWFpuo\n— Governor Kristi Noem (@govkristinoem) March 28, 2021  First of all, Kristi, these are fire. I\u0026rsquo;ve always loved 97s. Second of all, God-given eternal soul? I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but if we\u0026rsquo;re talking souls, yours is not in the greatest of shape. Just type \u0026ldquo;Kristi Noem scandal\u0026rdquo; into Google for more (mostly misusing taxpayer dollars, giving a raise to her daughter while bemoaning budget issues and bullying high schoolers). What was it the Bible said about the rich man getting into Heaven? If this is what \u0026ldquo;fight hard, fight smart\u0026rdquo; looks like, I think the rest of us are gonna be just fine.\nBut the real treat is poopy pants gun girl. I don\u0026rsquo;t know how to spell her name (Caytlin? Kaytlyn? Kaiytliyn?), but I like PPGG as an acronym. Anyway, she hit a triple word score in her responses–racism, homophobia (tweeting \u0026ldquo;At least I can procreate\u0026rdquo;) and victimhood in a Twitter fight she started. All Lil Nas X did was call her \u0026ldquo;shitty pants,\u0026rdquo; and SPGG, like the good Karen she is, huffed and puffed and\u0026hellip;went with racism. And for funzies, she claimed Lil Nas X threatened to rape her father. That\u0026rsquo;s textbook stuff; pick a fight, respond with racism, play the victim when the other person responds.\nDo you still see your dad? https://t.co/yZhocQvvE5\n— Kaitlin Bennett (@KaitMarieox) March 29, 2021  Are people really this dumb? I know they are, but we\u0026rsquo;ve been having this conversation since before I was born. MUSIC is ART, it is a medium for SELF EXPRESSION. Lil Nas X is an artist who has made it abundantly clear he can, and will, do whatever he damn well pleases. Children will consume art, music especially, and connect with whatever resonates with them. If you, as a parent, decide it\u0026rsquo;s inappropriate, that\u0026rsquo;s your prerogative. It probably isn\u0026rsquo;t the best thing to show your 8-year-old, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean they can\u0026rsquo;t bump the song if they enjoy it. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to like the visuals or the song because your tastes are your tastes. But if your gut reaction to this video is to say \u0026ldquo;THIS is what\u0026rsquo;s wrong with America,\u0026rdquo; you\u0026rsquo;ve lost the plot. What\u0026rsquo;s wrong with America is not a music video; it\u0026rsquo;s an endless list of real-world sh*t that makes our lives worse such as, in recent memory, the still-not-under-control pandemic approaching a 600K death toll, mass shootings every week, unprompted violence against the AAPI community, etc. Also, FWIW, Lil Nas X snaps the devil\u0026rsquo;s neck at the end of the video–he defeated Satan by distracting him with ass. Kristi and PPGG aren\u0026rsquo;t with killing the devil? The soul of this nation may truly be unsafe.\n It\u0026rsquo;s a rollout, folks; bad press is still good press, and this isn\u0026rsquo;t even bad press–the video is dope. None of the outraged parties would\u0026rsquo;ve known about or given a second thought to this song, video, the shoes, etc. if their sh*tty little interns hadn\u0026rsquo;t tucked it away for faux-outrage Monday. Yes, it\u0026rsquo;s just one of the countless side effects of American culture/politics, but this particular meaningless debate is decades old. We did this dance with jazz, then rock, then metal, then hip-hop. WE DID IT TWO MONTHS AGO WITH \u0026ldquo;WET ASS PUSSY.\u0026rdquo; So of course it stands to reason that the \u0026ldquo;Old Town Road\u0026rdquo; guy face-f_cking the devil will be the end of us all. And you\u0026rsquo;re going to hell if you liked anything about it.\nLil Nas X usually walks the line well between trolling and making a point, and I think he\u0026rsquo;s at it again. I\u0026rsquo;d imagine people have been telling LNX he\u0026rsquo;s going to hell ever since he came out as gay (or even before). To me, he flipped that notion on its head and went to hell, shall we say, on his terms. He described this song as a love letter to his younger self, so that all seems to check out. The video was clearly well-conceived, looks super expensive and seems like a cathartic moment for LNX. At the same time, he told us this was a rollout. LNX came up on Twitter; he\u0026rsquo;s punching down to these clueless, humorless, soulless asswipes. His responses are extremely benign compared to what\u0026rsquo;s being said about him. But you need attention to capitalize on your talent these days, and LNX is doing just that. Stir sh*t, sell records, and if you don\u0026rsquo;t like it, tough toodles.\nThis won\u0026rsquo;t be a story next week (EDITOR\u0026rsquo;S NOTE: It is a story, because \u0026ldquo;MONTERO\u0026rdquo; went #1 on Billboard, LNX\u0026rsquo;s second #1 hit record). The right will have moved on to something equally banal and unproductive, and the left will do the same. But stop doing this to music–nobody\u0026rsquo;s making anybody listen to anything. Political music can be great and add a lot to larger conversations, but this is a pop song with some wild visuals. Lo and behold, he\u0026rsquo;s not even the first musician to use Satanic imagery. Let artists create what they want, let people enjoy what resonates with them and, to borrow a talking point from the GOP, mind your business.\n The story behind this performance is worth reading–in short, free concert, too many people, lots of drugs, Hell\u0026rsquo;s Angels as the security, four deaths and a near-shooting of the Rolling Stones. It was carnage; some call it the death of the 60s. Ironically, Ronald Reagan was governor of CA at the time.\n","date":"30 March, 2021","id":4,"permalink":"/hater/hotd-3-29-god-fearing-americans/","summary":"Yes, I know it\u0026rsquo;s stupid and you don\u0026rsquo;t care, but Lil Nas X has whipped up quite the frenzy on Twitter with the new vid for \u0026ldquo;MONTERO (Call Me By Your Name).\u0026rdquo; Sparknotes version: he\u0026rsquo;s in heaven, descends a CGI stripper pole into hell, red wig swirling around him, to shake ass in the devil\u0026rsquo;s face while wearing thigh-high leather boots and briefs.

I’m not a big award show guy, but I love music much more than I do movies or TV. I’d give both up to have music on my deserted island, if you will.\nAnyway, the Grammys were last night, and I could’ve cared less. Not an original stance, I concede, but there’s a reason for that. It’s not the lack of star power, it isn’t the lack of pageantry, it’s not the lack of performances or anything else about the show. The show usually kicks ass–unlimited budget, biggest names, biggest stage, labels muscling their artists into noms and wins.\n The Grammy Committee delegitimized their own award, to me, because I know it\u0026rsquo;s rigged. That\u0026rsquo;s a fan perspective, because I\u0026rsquo;ve only ever known that side of the equation (clarinet lessons notwithstanding). I can\u0026rsquo;t speak for artists, but they\u0026rsquo;ve spoken about it plenty. In pretty clear language, too. In fact, an artist telling us about the Committee pulling something like this is why I put virtual ink to virtual paper. It’s not the whole story, but definitely the tipping point.\nThe way the situation with The Weeknd was handled sealed it for me, but the deal was done long ago. Here\u0026rsquo;s a pretty good rundown (by Good Housekeeping, no less!) that touches on the ultimatum issued by the committee. How can you tell one of the maybe 5 musicians in the world right now that can do any event they want anywhere in the world that he must choose between the Super Bowl and the Grammys? As if. It was a ridiculous move made more flagrant by their subsequent blackballing of the man’s music at the “premier” music award show on the planet. Why else wouldn\u0026rsquo;t he be there?\u0026ldquo;Blinding Lights\u0026rdquo; was song of the year; I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure everybody with the financial means to license that song used it for something. I really liked the album myself; \u0026ldquo;Heartless\u0026rdquo; has to be one of my favorites from him ever, and I probably have half of the songs downloaded. It was a better-sounding, better-executed Starboy with the huge single to match. \u0026ldquo;Blinding Lights\u0026rdquo; would\u0026rsquo;ve won Song of the Year–point, blank, period. Weeknd would\u0026rsquo;ve probably picked up another 2 or 3 to boot. But when the Grammys said jump and Weeknd didn’t say “how high?,” his music somehow loses its acclaim. For the committee, I suppose it\u0026rsquo;s because Weeknd just did the only live performance that can really rival the Grammys–the Super Bowl Halftime Show. But still, they got pissy and threw this fit, and they look like huge tools. They are, and they\u0026rsquo;ve always acted like it.\n Being younger, my introduction to those signature Grammy sham moments was 2013. Kendrick had GKMC up for Rap Album of the Year, along with Nothing Was the Same, along with Yeezus, along with a Jay-Z album. And then there was Macklemore.\nYou know the details, but GKMC turned out to be a defining album of the decade, Kendrick went on to build Top Dawg into one of the best labels in the industry, Kanye is\u0026hellip;doing his thing, Jay is his own empire and Drake is well on his way. I had every album up for the award in my phone except the Macklemore one. I always hated \u0026ldquo;Thrift Shop\u0026rdquo; and it still gives me hives. Magna Carta aside (remember, a mid Jay-Z album is still better than 75% of albums), the other three are classic entries in the catalogues of their respective icons. But the Grammys said Macklemore had album of the year. Even the man himself didn’t agree. To his credit, after the weird apology, Macklemore just kinda kept to himself. He quietly slid out of the public eye after the whole debacle and is enjoying life as a family man and father. He also has a pretty nice golf swing. Good for you, Mack.\nFast forward to 2021, and it’s the same dirty diaper, different day. The hip-hop and R\u0026amp;B genres have largely distanced themselves from the award (i.e. they don\u0026rsquo;t show up and tweet things like \u0026ldquo;F*ck the Grammys\u0026rdquo;), but that doesn’t make it meaningless. It’s a goal for lots of artists, it takes a lot to even be considered at that level and there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of history there. The winners are typically deserving and it\u0026rsquo;s produced some legendary performances (2021 included).\nvia GIPHY\nBeing run by white people, the Grammys have managed to distance themselves from the genre that dictates culture, defines what is cool, influences how other genres sound like no other and will have the most staying power with future generations. It’s a long-winded way of saying if young music lovers don’t care now, imagine how little they’ll care in a decade. Artists can keep boycotting\nBut again, this all stems from THE COMMITTEE. These are the people who decide why and how horrendous decisions continue to be made. Who calls the shots can and will change, but right now it\u0026rsquo;s just another chapter in the story of the committee flipping the collective bird. They are my Haters of the Day because of their willful ignorance. They hear endless amounts of valid criticism from artists and fans, only to continue doing the exact same thing in the face of intensified scrutiny. . They’ll always get viewers, but the premier matters less and less to music fans with each passing year.

It was my first time, but I\u0026rsquo;m generally unconcerned about the specifics of such an establishment and more interested in the fact that I can buy an adult beverage there. Accordingly, I had no idea what I\u0026rsquo;d find.\nRewinding a bit, I was not in the best form that evening. I had managed to ring my own bell (usually you can find someone at the spot to do that for you) at my buddies' house before striking out. While tossing a basketball to myself, I lightly tossed it off the underside of one of those doorway pull-up bars. Much to my surprise, it dislodged itself from the frame and dropped squarely onto the bridge of my nose. It hurt a bit, but I shook it off, tried and failed to reinstall the bar and ended up just leaning it against the wall.\nAs I came around the corner into the kitchen, one of my friends looked up and was immediately confused.\u0026ldquo;Jake, why are you bleeding?\u0026rdquo; My nose was still a bit numb, but just then I felt something warm on my face. I ducked into the bathroom, flicked on the light and saw that I was indeed bleeding. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t anything major, but the bar had taken a sizable flap of skin along for the ride on its way down my nose. Given the trail of blood started right between my eyes, it was tough to miss.\nThe Uber was under 10 minutes out. Knowing little about how nose cuts but far more about how unfit I was to do apply any actual aid, I figured the skin flap would need to stay, a Band-Aid was a no-go and that my best bet was a wet tissue. I pinned one on the cut, stopped the bleeding and felt pretty good about my future as a medic.\nAs I was waiting around and laughing it off, the physical act of smiling cracked the scab and opened the cut again. Normally, not being able to smile would play right into my hands, but I was out of time. I snatched a fresh tissue and piled into the backseat holding it to my nose. Fortunately for me, a 25-minute ride gives the human body plenty of time to do its thing and staunch the bleeding.\nAs I looked around Emporium, I noticed there weren\u0026rsquo;t a lot of white people there, and the ones that were there had huddled in the back around some pinball machines. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to hear the Chainsmokers or Party in the USA from the DJ booth, so I was very pleased by this development. I snagged a couple Old Styles because they were $3 and shimmied over to the dance floor. I soon discovered it was 90s R\u0026amp;B night, and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t have been any happier. I came to love the genre in the 2010s, but like any music fan, I know enough of the classics to be more than content with that selection.\n \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s our beer and they can\u0026rsquo;t have it\u0026rdquo; has to be the worst beer tagline ever. We can have it, for next to nothing, and nobody wants it anyway.\nAfter a couple more adult beverages, I was ready to unlock my joints a bit. I shuffled toward the back of the room and found a bit of space to be a spazz without bumping into any couples trying to enjoy their evening. I thought I was blending in fine, but a white dude with a large cut on his nose dancing oddly and looking kind of sweaty with a beer in hand caught a few eyes in a sea of young, in love Black couples. I didn\u0026rsquo;t really get into R\u0026amp;B until ~10 years after the era being featured, so I was mostly just singing the hooks, looking crazy and butchering some dance moves. Come to think of it, the Old Styles probably tipped everyone else off.\nEventually, a group of Black women took pity on me. One of them tapped me on the shoulder, saying \u0026ldquo;You look like you need some help.\u0026rdquo; Then she took a step back to do a full appraisal–no rhythm, cheap beer, no significant other to be seen and a newly healed cut to the face. At that point, I stopped trying to dance all together. I figured she must be spot-on; if she and her friends felt compelled enough to approach me, I must really be in a state.\nvia GIPHY\nThe woman who spoke up first then offered to show me some steps. I gladly took her up on it knowing I can\u0026rsquo;t dance and that free lessons weren\u0026rsquo;t often forthcoming at such establishments. She got me back on beat, the friend group had a couple more chuckles at my footwork and, finally, I kinda had the hang of it. Unfortunately, the DJ cut on an Aaliyah song, the universal signal to GTFO. Upon hearing that story on the ride home, my nice friend said she was trying to kick a little game to me; everyone else was far less generous in their assessment. I tend to agree with the latter.\n In any case, during the first month or so of the pandemic, I reminisced on that night a lot. My longings to go dance, drink, hear loud music and people-watch were crystalized in that rather ordinary Friday night; I had expected nothing and had a fabulous time anyway. I just wanted to be able to do that again (and still do). But while at Emporium, I remember thinking I\u0026rsquo;d look a lot cooler if the songs were from 5-10 years later and I could base my ungainly movements on a tempo and lyrics I knew.\nSo, I made a playlist: THE EMPORIUM BAG. It\u0026rsquo;s some late 90s/early 2000s R\u0026amp;B that I love and that would still do something in the right room. You\u0026rsquo;ll find some Beyoncé, some Mariah, some Trey, some newer stuff from the Summer Walker/Ella Mai lane, etc. The theme is R\u0026amp;B for your night out–something with a little bounce, something you probably heard on the radio and (hopefully) something that will drum up some good memories.\n","date":"14 March, 2021","id":6,"permalink":"/music/a-playlist-and-a-story-r-b/","summary":"Right before the pandemic started, I went with a pair of friends to a \u0026ldquo;club\u0026rdquo; (large bar) north of The Loop in Chicago called Emporium.

It can be a shame to witness as a fan, an even bigger shame when the front office doesn’t know how to handle it. There are degrees to the art; a full teardown and rebuild, on-the-fly in the mediocre zone, endless searching for complementary pieces, etc. The OKC Thunder are in the midst of a great one–outside looking in on the playoff picture, but with a play-in tourney ceiling, marked growth from their young star and a well-conceived supporting cast. The Suns deserve a mention here as well, but they\u0026rsquo;re enjoying their first season of truly being competitive. We’ll stick to the NBA for the purposes of this blog because the smaller roster size best illustrates my favorite type of rebuild.\n Cannot wait for SGA to make his first All-Star game in 2022\nAnd that would be…those rare, beautiful seasons where your rebuild is just spare parts cast off from other rebuilds. There’s a couple ways to get here as a team, but it typically involves some combination of the following: young pieces that aren’t ready, limited cap space from bad contracts left over from aging stars/pieces, a need to “make something happen” (i.e. fill a roster). Maybe sprinkle in a new coach/GM, add a dash of underperforming holdovers, a pinch of low expectations and you’ve got the perfect scenario to bring in a bunch of spare parts and see what happens.\nWhy is it my favorite type of rebuild? Because it’s as close as we get to an actual island of misfit toys. It also produces some head-scratching rosters (think this season’s Pistons, last year\u0026rsquo;s Wizards/Knicks). I go back to the 2018-19 Bulls, a team I watched far too much of, as an example. Their best player was Zack Lavine, who they got in the Jimmy Butler trade with Minnesota. Ditto for Kris Dunn, ditto for Lauri Markkanen (who they took with that Wolves pick). Aside from Wendell Carter Jr. and Chandler Hutchinson (both rookies), all contributors of note were castoffs from other rebuilds.\n Otto Porter Jr. came over midseason after the Wizards realized their window was being slammed shut and somehow decided Bobby Portis and Jabari Parker were the answer. TLC was a Process cast-off. Justin Holiday (an OG Processor) was back for a second stint after bopping around the league. Cam Payne and Robin Lopez were both consummate journeymen. Aside from Lopez, Holiday and Porter, nobody had more than 5 years NBA service at the start of the season. Oh, and they fired Fred Hoiberg (meh) midseason for Jim Boylen (much, much worse).\n I did game night media relations for the Bulls in \u0026lsquo;18-\u0026lsquo;19, and some of those early Boylen press conferences were BRUTAL. Dude is not the best at dealing with media and beat writers were more or less laughing in his face after every loss. Can only image what it was like the following year.\nThe reason you don’t build cars out of spare parts is because they run like ass and break down. Same rules apply to basketball teams; for that Bulls roster, 22-60 was how they ran. But there\u0026rsquo;s always someone in that zone. It takes a couple years, some bad decisions, the wrong people at the wheel and some bad luck, but it happens. At times, it’s a necessary evil; those high-priced dudes you shipped out need replacements, but you swung and missed at the top levels of free agency (hi 2010s Knicks, small market teams). Your lottery pick(s) isn’t ready, but he needs playing time. You want a strong bench to support your dream starting 5 down the road, but first you gotta see who out of the washed-up free agents and non-lottery draft picks are worth a flier.\nAll that said, sometimes it works. I\u0026rsquo;m harkening again, this time back to one of my favorite teams–the 2016-17 Celtics. For those who forget, they somehow finished first in the East, finagled their way into the ECF and got blown out by year one of Cleveland Bron: Reloaded. It’s not a perfect example; Jaylen Brown (year 2), Jayson Tatum (rookie), Terry Rozier, Avery Bradley and Kelly Olynk were all Boston draft picks, but those were the first signs of life between the post-Big 3 rock bottom (call it 2013) and and the Tatum-Brown core of today. Al Horford was the first big name free agent to come to town in years, but only because he saw the writing on the wall for the Bud Hawks. Other than that, the rotation was filled out with a bunch of names that wouldn’t strike fear into many hearts; Jae Crowder, Tyler Zeller, Jonas Jerebko, Gerald Green and Amir Johnson all played A LOT of minutes. And then there’s Isaiah Thomas, jettisoned from the Suns rebuild (remember their triple point guard experiment?) only to have one of the most electric single seasons by a mediocre player in recent memory. Much of the credit goes to Brad Stevens for bringing the best out of that roster, but there’s something to be said for the players themselves making it work.\n Never forget that Kelly Olynyk tipped over the first domino that eventually resulted in the end of the Wall-Beal Wizards\nThen you have teams like last year\u0026rsquo;s Knicks. Let\u0026rsquo;s remove R.J. Barrett, Mitchell Robinson, Frank Ntilikina and Kevin Knox (I guess) from the equation as the \u0026ldquo;young core,\u0026rdquo; and Julius Randle as a good signing that\u0026rsquo;s paying off tremendously this season. But the rest? Taj Gibson\u0026rsquo;s brightest days were with the D-Rose Bulls, but even Minnesota–another offender here–couldn\u0026rsquo;t bring themselves to give him minutes. Boston decided Marcus Morris Sr. was too expensive, and he was out. Both the Bulls and Wizards deemed Bobby Portis unfit for their own rebuilds. Higher up the food chain, the Blazers had no time for Mo Harkless and the Magic did the same to Elfrid Payton. The PISTONS saw half a season of both Wayne Ellington and Reggie Bullock before concluding they were not the solution. Dennis Smith Jr.\u0026rsquo;s lack of staying power has been similarly well-documented.\nPoint being, the spare parts rebuild usually goes poorly, but it’s not a death sentence. Hell, those seasons help you find a couple bench guys to tie your rotation together, give your draft picks some run (since the rest of your roster stinks) and teach your front office about failed rolls of the dice, both in the draft and free agency. When they stink, it’s expected, and if they overachieve, it’s a lot of fun as a fan. That volatility is what I love– never knowing what you’ll get, who’s going to win you a game, who’s cooked and who still has something left. Even as a Celtics fan today (and I\u0026rsquo;m sure plenty would agree), you get nostalgic for the surprisingly-good rebuild seasons, especially when later teams that are supposed to be good underperform (as in become a bottom-10 defensive team and the worst 4th quarter team in the league). Knicks and Suns fans especially seem to be having those first fun years after a long rebuild, so be sure support them in their fun.\nKNICKS COVERED *AND* THEY WON LFG #NewYorkForever pic.twitter.com/whmuPO4GLN\n\u0026mdash; THE KID MERO 🇩🇴 (@THEKIDMERO) March 28, 2021 ","date":"14 March, 2021","id":7,"permalink":"/sports-and-games/my-favorite-brand-of-nba-rebuild/","summary":"Ah, the rebuild.

There are degrees to the art; a full teardown and rebuild, on-the-fly in the mediocre zone, endless searching for complementary pieces, etc. The OKC Thunder are in the midst of a great one–outside looking in on the playoff picture, but with a play-in tourney ceiling, marked growth from their young star and a well-conceived supporting cast.","tags":"","title":"My Favorite Brand of (NBA) Rebuild "},{"content":"Baseball cards are one of the few “relics” that remain popular, both with nostalgics, a bit with modern kids and now, via a leap online, NFTs (I’m not talking about those because I don’t know enough). There aren’t many others; bikes and skateboards come to mind, dolls and dollhouses too, I\u0026rsquo;m sure there are more. But even I, someone who mostly grew up in the 21st century, feel like an old man when thinking about what kids are raised on today. I never had video games (because of my parents), wasn’t really on the internet until middle school and walked around with a flip phone in my pocket until high school. My sister, three years younger, had a smartphone by the time she got to 9th grade.\nThe fact that the baseball card, and the sports card in general, made it to my generation is a minor miracle. Baseball has been badly outstripped by football and basketball in the minds, lives and feeds of American kids. I can’t speak much on modern children considering I have none, but I imagine sports cards don’t quite match up to Candy Crush or an Xbox. And yet, they survive. I can appreciate its timeless appeal for a kid that loves sports with the cool pictures, stats, collector’s appeal. But you can’t play games on it.\nI remember the first pack of cards I got. It was an old box set of 100+ from the late 80s/early 90s made of the flimsy, papery material that was the norm back then. My dad picked them up from Ocean State Job Lot. For those unfamiliar, the Lot is basically a Walmart with weirder, cheaper stuff. Finding a box of 25-year-old baseball cards is par for the course. I’d say they couldn’t have cost more than $10.\n An actual ad they did\nAt that point, I was eight or nine years old and a full-blown Red Sox fan following their curse–busting World Series win in ’04. Of course, I had no idea who any of the players in the old set were. I recognized Tony Gwynn, but only because his son was playing in the MLB by that point. But my love for cards arose from something else.\nNot long after I got that first set, one of my parents came home with a binder. Inside the binder were plastic pages with 12 little sleeves on them. Far from a child prodigy, I was confused about their purpose. They were for the cards and, newly enlightened, I set about organizing. I found countless ways to sort and order the cards; by team, color, position, last name and more. As I expanded my collection beyond baseball, I got more binders. Still, they were all dwarfed by the mammoth two-incher stuffed to the brim with random baseball players.\nBy then, I had advanced to current players. At the time (roughly ’05-’08), Topps were the easiest to find, so that’s what I bought. There were two card stores I frequented, both of which went under by 2010. They were little holes-in-the-wall, one on Main Street in Melrose and the other at the top of the Neck in Fairhaven. They were remarkably similar in layout and merchandise; long, narrow rooms filled with sports memorabilia and other relevant odds and ends. I would beg my dad to take me in each time we drove by, and he often would. A pack of cards was cheap (maybe $7), so the collection grew quickly.\n I would spend hours on the floor sorting. Each time a new pack or set arrived, all the cards had to come out. I would create little piles on the living room carpet based on that day’s organizational technique. It was a good activity for muggy summer days when going outside meant heatstroke wasn’t far off. It would take hours, but I was totally engrossed. Occasionally, I found trade partners (like real baseball!). I’d take a stack of players on the block over to friend’s houses and start dealing. I’d like to think I made some shrewd moves in my day.\nAfter amassing a sizable collection, I decided to figure out what it was worth. Being a child and knowing nothing about card collecting or sales, I assumed quantity equated to value. I received a card index from a relative for my birthday and set about totaling up my collection. As I soon realized, most of the cards I owned were worth a whopping…10 cents. The most valuable one I had was a Nomar (Nomahhhhhh) Cubs card that had a piece of his bat embedded. That went for a tasty…five dollars. All told, the collection was basically worthless. They’re still in my childhood bedroom.\nmake sports GIFs like this at MakeaGif\nCome to think of it, collecting baseball cards taught me a lot about organizing. As I progressed through school, I found I was much more put together than my peers when it came to tasks such as not losing homework. Can a direct line be drawn? Probably not, but it didn’t hurt. I’m sure kids everywhere could tell stories about the weird stuff they loved back in the day that somehow helped them down the road, and mine was baseball cards. And despite technology, despite the state of baseball, I reckon they’ll stick around a bit longer.\n","date":"12 March, 2021","id":8,"permalink":"/rants-and-stories/cards-i-used-to-know/","summary":"Baseball cards are one of the few “relics” that remain popular, both with nostalgics, a bit with modern kids and now, via a leap online, NFTs (I’m not talking about those because I don’t know enough).

Usually, as your health deteriorates, the ability to hold your solid waste also deteriorates. Defecating oneself is also a problem that mostly affects the two age groups at the tips of the human bell curve; infants and the elderly. A teenager, however, is thought to be approaching the prime of their physical powers and certainly not a likely candidate for such an episode. But, alas, life is funny sometimes.\nBefore diving into my tale of misery and woe, a couple disclaimers. First, there is no shame in such an event ONCE EVERY FEW YEARS. Sh*t happens; we’ve all been marooned in traffic or on the train or somewhere inexplicably lacking a commode when that feeling hits. If nothing else, I hope you found a bathroom in the aftermath of your little accident to try and piece back together whatever remains of your pride.\nSecond, skid marks do not count. I’m going to be talking about a complete bowel release, not a little rosebud left for the laundry. Finally, one more request. As you read this story, see if you can remember the last time (or any time, for that matter) that it happened to you. It’s a humorous way to sift through your memory because, as I’ve long maintained, poop is always funny.\n In high school, I rowed competitively for four years; we raced in the fall and the spring, trained outside in the summer and spent winters on the machines in what was also the wrestling room. It was journey of mediocrity interspersed with brief flashes of brilliance that afforded me some neat opportunities to race in exotic locales such as St. Catherine’s, Ontario. For those who don’t know, SC sits just 20 minutes over the American border, meaning it is simply an extension of northwestern New York. But because it is technically Canada, the businesses you would expect to see in a similar American town were masquerading under pseudonyms. For example, SportChek is Dick’s Sporting Goods, Tim Horton’s is Dunkin’ Donuts. However, the one universal name brand store that will ultimately catalyze my little incident shone like a beacon in a wasteland of Canadian knockoffs, beckoning warmly to a hungry pack of American teenagers looking to eat as much as possible as quickly as possible.\nNow, I am not a big chain pizza guy; I’ve spent most of my life in the Boston area and the Chicago area, two major metropolitan locations with actual pizza restaurants that serve actual pizza. In a pinch, I will absolutely indulge in some Domino’s, but again, not my thing. But this was our first night in Canada, nobody had a car, and we were traveling in a group of 20 on foot. With options and daylight dwindling, the red roof of Pizza Hut hove into view.\nTo be clear, this was the worst chain pizza restaurant I have ever been to–any brand, any state, any country. It took over an hour for them to make four calzones; four PIZZA HUT calzones. I don’t remember much about how it tasted, probably because I don’t want to. Let’s just assumed it sucked and keep moving.\nBecause we had been stuffed in the back of a van for 10 hours, I wolfed down my quadrant. I thought nothing of it until the next morning at 5 AM, when I found myself parked on the toilet pissing out of my ass. Now normally, ass pee can be managed with ease; don’t get too adventurous, plan your day carefully around locations with bathrooms you know and love, and wait for whatever it was that caused the brown rain to leave your system. In my experience, it’s a 12-to-24 hour phenomenon at the most and occasionally results in just two or three runny, loud dumps.\nFamily Guy Peter Griffin GIF from Familyguy GIFs However, the reason I was up at 5 AM was because I had to be on the water at 6 AM to practice for the week’s races. I wasn’t worried yet; it felt like I had eliminated most of the offending calzone on the first try, and my stomach wasn’t particularly sore. I figured I could make it two or three hours and thought nothing of it until the precise moment we pushed off the dock.\nFor those who have never sat in a rowing shell, there is no bathroom on board. You sit about six inches off the water in a boat just wider than your hips, and you have about three feet to operate front to back. The issues for me began there; I had nowhere to go. I couldn’t jump into the water, I couldn’t force the boat back to shore because practice time was at a premium, and I certainly couldn’t let it go. That meant sitting there trying to row (a fairly strenuous, full-body physical activity) and not think about the storm brewing in my lower intestine or the fact that I easily could have nipped off to the bathroom before we started.\n But the Pizza Hut calzone was far from finished with me, and about an hour into practice it was two-foot dropkicking the backdoor. I suffered silently, unable to do anything except clench as hard as I possibly could. It was exhausting work, and ten minutes from time I gave in. Even if I held on a bit longer, I would have lost it on the dock or on my way to the porta-potty. It was actually the best place for me to have a situation that day; because it was, of course, diarrhea , the viscosity and small size of the turd allowed it to be quickly washed off the deck of the boat with a couple big splashes of water. I rinsed down my legs and water bottle while I was at it, actually feeling pretty good about the whole thing heading to land. The black spandex hid the discoloration, the water washed away the evidence and the lake breeze took care of the smell. As I hustled around the staging area looking for a porta-potty, I really thought I might just get away with this one.\nvia GIFER\nBut in the final, cruelest twist of fate, I had actually picked the worst place on planet earth to sh_t myself. The bathrooms at a sporting event are about as prehistoric as the modern man gets, but rowing regattas are a different animal because they bring the porta-potty into play. There were hundreds of teams at this race, each with dozens of athletes and coaches, and precisely zero indoor commodes. It was the first week of August, and like the country it tries so hard to imitate, Canada also gets very, very hot around that time of the year. There were MAYBE six plastic palaces within reach, and all of them had been marinating in the sun for several days at the mercy of rather large athletes consuming their body weight in carbs. It was, for lack of a better word, a sh_tstorm of epic proportions.\nThe first hopper I visited made me gag, and there was no toilet paper. That would become a recurring theme, so eventually I got desperate. There was still residue on my ass and my thighs, but I had nothing to wipe with. I ran back to my bag and grabbed the only article of clothing I could spare: my boxers. I boogied back over to the nearest potty and tried to wipe the (now dry) refuse off myself before launching the underwear, the spandex shorts I had been wearing and my socks into the toilet. I allowed myself a brief, ultimately premature, sigh of relief.\n **i don\u0026rsquo;t have a workaround for this yet–I know it makes you watch it on YouTube. Does it for NFL clips, too. Anyway, this is the Steve-O porta-potty slingshot prank from Jackass 3D. It\u0026rsquo;s awesome and you\u0026rsquo;ve probably seen it but watch it again.\nWhile there were no visible signs of my ordeal, I had been missing for ten minutes and returned clearly free-balling in my gym shorts. Luckily for me, I was at a rowing event, a place where men can walk around naked save for a spandex diaper and nobody bats an eye. However, I quickly realized I needed to pass one more level before I could get a proper shower–the van ride back to the hotel. Remember, it’s August, and the van has been in the lot baking for three hours. I had been sitting in my own feces for the better part of an hour, and the extent of my cleaning was a rinse with muddy lake water followed by a quick wipe-down with a pair of thin boxers Packed into a hot van, that lingering smell bloomed. But my savior on this occasion was something I don’t think has ever benefitted me at any other time; the pungent, overwhelming body odor of the teenage male. Still, once the door closed, one sharp-nosed teammate was kind enough to point out, \u0026ldquo;It smells like sh*t in here.\u0026rdquo; I kept my head down, my shirt over my nose, and twenty minutes later I took another horrific dump before finally getting into the shower.\nTo put a bow on this overwritten tale, nobody found out that the smell was me. Rather, nobody confronted me directly about it, even though I imagine the young man sitting behind me in the boat that day knew exactly what happened (he now works for Sean Hannity. I hope I got some crap on him). The calzone ravaged my lower intestine for the rest of the day and much of the next, but I wasn’t good enough to be rowing that often and managed to find a toilet each time brown rain entered the forecast. I have no idea what happened; I’m not lactose intolerant or allergic to any foods, so I\u0026rsquo;m going to place 100% of the blame on the Pizza Hut in St. Catherine\u0026rsquo;s, Ontario.\nMost stories this long provide some sort of life lesson or deep insight into human nature, none of which I have handy. Still, I’ll do you the unnecessary courtesy of revealing what this little accident taught me.\n Don\u0026rsquo;t be ashamed to poop yourself (once every few years, if nobody finds out). Be wary of chain pizza. You are never in total control of your own anus.

Unlike the real sports journos of yore, I did not make a promise to eat my own column should my sage predictions be proven wrong. I also didn’t get it published in time. Or anywhere, for that matter. And yet here we are.\nIn any case, that version was quite a bit different. It started off with something about going 4-2 down the stretch and deteriorated from there. I’ll spare you the details, but please know it came from a part of my brain that still thought the dynasty was alive. And I’m glad it never saw the light of day because you might confuse me for a Pats fanboy.\nI am a card-carrying Pats fanboy still a bit hungover from the glory of my childhood/teenage year/college years, but this season was a slow motion kick to the bits. I imagine most Pats fans agree. It’s long overdue in the grand scheme of things; I loosely equate it to last year’s Warriors team minus the top 2 pick at the end of the shitbow. FWIW, our reign of terror was much longer anyway.\nvia GIPHY\nAny Pats fan with a brain stem had lower expectations for this season. Sure, you said they’d win the division after Cam Newton signed, but you weren’t alone (regionally). No matter how sweet his black-and-white offseason training videos looked, reality was bound to set in. The man had to replace the greatest QB of all time, during a global pandemic, after his new team logged the most opt-outs in the NFL, and with a receiving/tight end corps that was, uh, thin at best and useless at worst (hi N’Keal!). You can’t be that surprised the offense had severe growing pains; a QB/coach duo creates a system with the same coordinator and runs it to perfection for 10+ years. It stands to reason 1 A.T. (After Tom) would be tough. Cam never got the time or prep he needed, and his body was never right. Add in his pass catchers, COVID, canceled bye week, you catch my drift.\nThe Pats lost some games they shouldn’t have in 2020, but they won a lot of games (big games) they shouldn’t have over the past two-ish decades. It was to be expected, really; remove Tom Brady from the equation, watch that win percentage in those games dip. Some of them were maddening–the Cam stuff vs. SEA and Cam fumble vs. BUF stand out–but that is what we’ve watched other fanbases deal with for years. In hindsight, this was a pretty good preview.\n But to me, the Patriots were entertaining, even when they lost. I respect the limited amount of blowouts, the commitment to lingering just long enough to make me watch the 4th quarter and the newfound ability to shoot themselves in the foot in key situations. We even got to play the “In the Hunt” game for a couple weeks.\nBut as a Pats fan, you can’t be that mad. You took a shot on a former MVP for a bargain, and even though he didn\u0026rsquo;t hit his stride, you never heard a bad thing about Cam from the locker room or media. Bill’s still there, Josh is still there (for now), and a cohort of Belichick sons and former linebackers should have the defense covered. Sony Michel and Damien Harris ought to be an above-average backfield tandem for the next few years. They found enough low-ceiling, high-effort guys to plug the gaps and keep things vaguely interesting. I\u0026rsquo;m sure Jakobi Meyers earned another look. We were also introduced to a couple keepers on defense–Josh Uche and Kyle Dugger most notably. The O-line did a bang-up job, especially considering it was pretty easy to plan for a run-based attack. Special teams were stellar, per usual (shoutout to Jake Bailey and the old man Nick Folk).\n Plenty of disappointments too. Receivers and tight ends, obviously, but no Edelman hurt. N’Keal Harry continuing the trend of crappy 2010s receiver draft picks wasn’t pleasant, and the same could be said about the extremely noticeable lack of production from a tight end group that\u0026rsquo;s typically a point of emphasis. The defense couldn’t knuckle down consistently enough when they needed stops, especially against the run. But most obvious, at least to the casual eye, were the screwups in key situations–turnovers, penalties, can’t-get-a-key-stop, stalled drives. It’s not to say they didn’t catch their share of breaks or didn’t make ANY clutch plays. It was just a striking difference–especially when you built a dynasty on winning those pivotal moments of football games–to continue finding your team on the other side of that equation.\n But again, nothing more than a mild air of disappointment from me on this Pats season. The playoffs were still compelling, with plenty of juicy storylines for Pats fans. A quick rundown: the Big Ben era is over in Pittsburgh (he resigned, I know, but c\u0026rsquo;mon), Buffalo taking up the mantle for the AFC East, everyone caught up with John Harbaugh again. Even the ones with no loose connection were fun: Browns won a game! Extra wild card teams! One bye! Crying Drew Brees! COVID hanging over everything! Patty Mahomes isn\u0026rsquo;t worth his contract (he is)! The NFC was never actually that good! Oh, and the old man got his 7th.\nvia GIFER\nOnly one ring!\nPats fans, I hope you enjoyed some playoff football with no deeply personal, unnecessarily weighty emotions riding on it. Throw on a championship DVD if you’re feeling down about your team–there’s six to choose from. And look forward to next year; Bill will have his last laugh, one way or another. It might not be next year, but history suggests you might want to stick around and find out.\n","date":"11 February, 2021","id":10,"permalink":"/massholery/the-2020-patriots-weren-t-good...and-that-s-ok/","summary":"I wrote a different version of this blog after Week 13, when the Pats sat at 6-6.
