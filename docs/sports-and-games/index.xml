      <title>Why I Love the Tour De France</title>
      <link>https://thepileTKSM.com/sports-and-games/why-i-love-the-tour-de-france/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I wrote this a couple years back, so modern-day editor&amp;rsquo;s notes will be italicized&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s very un-American of me to associate the 4th of July with the start of the Tour de France, but I do. Don’t worry, chest-beating Americans, it’s a secondary thought stuffed somewhere behind blowing up colorful explosives in honor of our nation’s birth and drinking heavily regardless of the hour or day of the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;tenor-gif-embed&#34; data-postid=&#34;12205538&#34; data-share-method=&#34;host&#34; data-width=&#34;100%&#34; data-aspect-ratio=&#34;1.7785714285714287&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://tenor.com/view/tour-de-france-tdf-gif-12205538&#34;&gt;Tour De France GIF&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;https://tenor.com/search/tourdefrance-gifs&#34;&gt;Tourdefrance GIFs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script type=&#34;text/javascript&#34; async src=&#34;https://tenor.com/embed.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the next logical question would be why watch the Tour? On paper, it’s a competition between a large field of rail-thin men peddling bikes–yes, bicycles–across the country of France for hundreds of miles a day over 21 stages to see who can do it in the least amount of time. Snooze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the Tour de France represents some of the best sports programming on your television this summer (and every summer) because it&amp;rsquo;s one the toughest tests of human endurance known to man. Add in men riding top-of-the-line, multi-thousand dollar racing bicycles at speeds ranging from 5 mph to 60 mph mere inches from each other’s wheels in packs often exceeding 100 riders for anywhere from an hour to six hours at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z7QubXYjAxA&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video player&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still no? Well, for us Americans, we like cheering for teams. They are easier to cheer for than individual players, and all you have to do is locate the nearest metropolis to find your allegiances. But some folks do like cheering for individuals; perhaps a bright young star on a team you don’t like or a former fan favorite traded away for cap space and players-to-be-named-later. Lucky for you, America, the Tour de France offers you the opportunity to do both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year [&lt;em&gt;2019&lt;/em&gt;], 22 teams took to the roads of France for the Tour. If you wanted to cheer along national lines, the Colorado-based Education First team is your choice. If you like frontrunners, the powerhouse Team Ineos is your side [&lt;em&gt;they won&lt;/em&gt;]. If you want to ride the long-suffering French cycling bandwagon (the last French winner of the Tour won the event in 1985), then the AG2R La Mondiale squad fits the bill. If you harbor a passion for Spanish telephone companies, then the Movistar outfit is for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/gQH3EPY03Tg&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video player&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the teams compete against each other to get the most riders across the line the fastest, the main attraction is the race for the yellow jersey, worn each stage by the rider with the lowest overall time. Each eight-man cohort features a team leader, the man with the best shot at a stage win or a high finish in the overall classification. Though Americans cycling fans are still waiting patiently for an elite rider of that caliber to fill the void left by you-know-who, there are a bevy of top-tier potential winners to get behind. Even if all the digital ink I’ve wasted hasn’t gotten you any closer to finding your team or rider, perhaps I can convince you to tune in for a stage and find one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;/gif/lance-armstrong-zip-it-PsbBL2&amp;quot; title=&amp;ldquo;Lance Armstrong &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;Zip It&amp;rdquo;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://i.makeagif.com/media/6-13-2015/PsbBL2.gif%22&#34;&gt;https://i.makeagif.com/media/6-13-2015/PsbBL2.gif&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; alt=&amp;ldquo;Lance Armstrong &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;Zip It&amp;rdquo;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;font-size:11px;&#34;&gt;make &lt;a href=&#34;https://thepileTKSM.com/&#34; title=&#34;make a gif&#34;&gt;funny GIFs&lt;/a&gt; like this at MakeaGif&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, the race for the yellow jersey occupies center stage for good reason. The logistical nightmares associated with winning the Tour de France is precisely why the handful of riders that compete annually for yellow create such a captivating sporting event. To win the Tour, you must BEGIN the race with the following items; a team talented, healthy and deep enough to guide you to the finish, peak physical condition unaffected by illness, injury or fatigue from training and warm-up races, and a team infrastructure developed and efficient enough to keep your equipment intact and your body operating for the entire three weeks. Once the race begins, you must avoid injury and illness at all costs. Your teammates must also avoid injury and illness at all costs, as a depleted team cannot protect and guide their captain to the finish line. Crashes happen nearly every stage, and staying on your bike is imperative to winning the Tour. You must account for the other riders gunning for the yellow jersey, marking their movements and countering their attacks to prevent too much time from slipping away. You must push your body to its physical limits for multiple hours and thousands of miles every day for three weeks straight. Most important of all, you need a healthy dose of luck. An ill-timed flat tire, a spectator stumbling into the road, bad road conditions, mistakes by other riders leading to field crashes, cobblestones, wind, heat, food poisoning, a bad day on the bike and more can all derail a yellow jersey campaign in an instant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQzOM1fVqsQ&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video player&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the long slog doesn’t wet your whistle, consider the three other jerseys awarded at the conclusion of the Tour. The green jersey goes to the best sprinter, the riders who don’t have the endurance to win the big show but represent a who’s-who of cycling’s fastest, most powerful drag racers. Nowadays, that jersey is perennially on the shoulder’s of the most interesting (bike racing) man in the world, Peter Sagan. The strategy, speed (usually a shade over 40 mph) and skill required for an effective sprint finish are reason enough to pay attention to the green jersey competition. For fans of endurance, the polka-dot jersey adorns the shoulders of the man who performs the best in the notoriously difficult mountain stages of the Tour. For Rookie of the Year lovers, the white jersey goes to the young (25 and under) rider who turns in the best time. In addition, each stage features its own hotly-contested search for a winner. For the majority of team riders, a stage win is their best hope for a moment of notoriety. This results in heroic performances from unheralded riders pulling themselves inside out for an afternoon in the spotlight, battling with top general classification contenders, sprinters, mountain specialists and other “role players” taking a crack at a stage win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/RohsW2mbWxk&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video player&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s tough to condense why you should watch the Tour de France down to a single reason or factor, so allow me to replay the hits. There’s plenty of avenues to fandom, whether it be for a team, an individual rider, underdogs, front runners, sprinters, mountain climbers, etc. Each day features, in one way or another, a special ride from the stage winner that is an inconceivable physical effort for ~99% of the world’s population. Each classification winner would be worth watching on their own, but they compete against and alongside each other for three weeks. There’s speed, danger, crashes, redemption stories, upstarts, underdogs, powerhouses and, most importantly, elite athletes at the peak of their abilities dueling with just their bodies and a bicycle across the mountains, plains, towns and cities of one of the most beautiful countries in the world. Even though there’s no balls, goals, fields, cheerleaders, hitting or tackling (plenty of contact though!), the man-and-his-machine nature of the race lends the Tour something American team sports lack. Not to get too prehistoric, but I contend it’s the idea of pushing the human body to its limits in direct competition with your fellow man that makes the race so appealing and entertaining. Even if you disagree, it might be a nice change of pace from a baseball game.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Favorite Brand of (NBA) Rebuild </title>
      <link>https://thepileTKSM.com/sports-and-games/my-favorite-brand-of-nba-rebuild/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 14 Mar 2021 21:25:05 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://thepileTKSM.com/sports-and-games/my-favorite-brand-of-nba-rebuild/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ah, the rebuild. It can be a shame to witness as a fan, an even bigger shame when the front office doesn’t know how to handle it. There are degrees to the art; a full teardown and rebuild, on-the-fly in the mediocre zone, endless searching for complementary pieces, etc. The OKC Thunder are in the midst of a great one–outside looking in on the playoff picture, but with a play-in tourney ceiling, marked growth from their young star and a well-conceived supporting cast. The Suns deserve a mention here as well, but they&amp;rsquo;re enjoying their first season of truly being competitive. We’ll stick to the NBA for the purposes of this blog because the smaller roster size best illustrates my favorite type of rebuild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/nPvhrO6YM1c&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video player&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cannot wait for SGA to make his first All-Star game in 2022&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that would be…those rare, beautiful seasons where your rebuild is just spare parts cast off from other rebuilds. There’s a couple ways to get here as a team, but it typically involves some combination of the following: young pieces that aren’t ready, limited cap space from bad contracts left over from aging stars/pieces, a need to “make something happen” (i.e. fill a roster). Maybe sprinkle in a new coach/GM, add a dash of underperforming holdovers, a pinch of low expectations and you’ve got the perfect scenario to bring in a bunch of spare parts and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it my favorite type of rebuild? Because it’s as close as we get to an actual island of misfit toys. It also produces some head-scratching rosters (think &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/DET/2021.html&#34;&gt;this season’s Pistons&lt;/a&gt;, last year&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/WAS/2020.html&#34;&gt;Wizards&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/NYK/2020.html&#34;&gt;Knicks&lt;/a&gt;). I go back to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CHI/2019.html&#34;&gt;2018-19 Bulls&lt;/a&gt;, a team I watched far too much of, as an example. Their best player was Zack Lavine, who they got in the Jimmy Butler trade with Minnesota. Ditto for Kris Dunn, ditto for Lauri Markkanen (who they took with that Wolves pick). Aside from Wendell Carter Jr. and Chandler Hutchinson (both rookies), all contributors of note were castoffs from other rebuilds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/MdVTBGEuxhM&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video player&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otto Porter Jr. came over midseason after the Wizards realized their window was being slammed shut and somehow decided Bobby Portis and Jabari Parker were the answer. TLC was a Process cast-off. Justin Holiday (an OG Processor) was back for a second stint after bopping around the league. Cam Payne and Robin Lopez were both consummate journeymen. Aside from Lopez, Holiday and Porter, nobody had more than 5 years NBA service at the start of the season. Oh, and they fired Fred Hoiberg (meh) midseason for Jim Boylen (much, much worse).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/c2gv3zSmMc4&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video player&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I did game night media relations for the Bulls in &amp;lsquo;18-&amp;lsquo;19, and some of those early Boylen press conferences were BRUTAL. Dude is not the best at dealing with media and beat writers were more or less laughing in his face after every loss. Can only image what it was like the following year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason you don’t build cars out of spare parts is because they run like ass and break down. Same rules apply to basketball teams; for that Bulls roster, 22-60 was how they ran. But there&amp;rsquo;s always someone in that zone. It takes a couple years, some bad decisions, the wrong people at the wheel and some bad luck, but it happens. At times, it’s a necessary evil; those high-priced dudes you shipped out need replacements, but you swung and missed at the top levels of free agency (hi 2010s Knicks, small market teams). Your lottery pick(s) isn’t ready, but he needs playing time. You want a strong bench to support your dream starting 5 down the road, but first you gotta see who out of the washed-up free agents and non-lottery draft picks are worth a flier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that said, sometimes it works. I&amp;rsquo;m harkening again, this time back to one of my favorite teams–&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/BOS/2017.html&#34;&gt;the 2016-17 Celtics&lt;/a&gt;. For those who forget, they somehow finished first in the East, finagled their way into the ECF and got blown out by year one of Cleveland Bron: Reloaded. It’s not a perfect example; Jaylen Brown (year 2), Jayson Tatum (rookie), Terry Rozier, Avery Bradley and Kelly Olynk were all Boston draft picks, but those were the first signs of life between the post-Big 3 rock bottom (call it 2013) and and the Tatum-Brown core of today. Al Horford was the first big name free agent to come to town in years, but only because he saw the writing on the wall for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2015/05/27/hawks-season-crashes--sweep--cavaliers/27997319/&#34;&gt;Bud Hawks&lt;/a&gt;. Other than that, the rotation was filled out with a bunch of names that wouldn’t strike fear into many hearts; Jae Crowder, Tyler Zeller, Jonas Jerebko, Gerald Green and Amir Johnson all played A LOT of minutes. And then there’s Isaiah Thomas, jettisoned from the Suns rebuild (remember their &lt;a href=&#34;https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2246377-3-point-guard-lineup-is-best-blueprint-for-phoenix-suns-success&#34;&gt;triple point guard experiment?&lt;/a&gt;) only to have one of the most electric single seasons by a mediocre player in recent memory. Much of the credit goes to Brad Stevens for bringing the best out of that roster, but there’s something to be said for the players themselves making it work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/n9-r2d8Yh94&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video player&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Never forget that Kelly Olynyk tipped over the first domino that eventually resulted in the end of the Wall-Beal Wizards&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you have teams like last year&amp;rsquo;s Knicks. Let&amp;rsquo;s remove R.J. Barrett, Mitchell Robinson, Frank Ntilikina and Kevin Knox (I guess) from the equation as the &amp;ldquo;young core,&amp;rdquo; and Julius Randle as a good signing that&amp;rsquo;s paying off tremendously this season. But the rest? Taj Gibson&amp;rsquo;s brightest days were with the D-Rose Bulls, but even Minnesota–another offender here–couldn&amp;rsquo;t bring themselves to give him minutes. Boston decided Marcus Morris Sr. was too expensive, and he was out. Both the Bulls and Wizards deemed Bobby Portis unfit for their own rebuilds. Higher up the food chain, the Blazers had no time for Mo Harkless and the Magic did the same to Elfrid Payton. The PISTONS saw half a season of both Wayne Ellington and Reggie Bullock before concluding they were not the solution. Dennis Smith Jr.&amp;rsquo;s lack of staying power has been similarly well-documented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Point being, the spare parts rebuild usually goes poorly, but it’s not a death sentence. Hell, those seasons help you find a couple bench guys to tie your rotation together, give your draft picks some run (since the rest of your roster stinks) and teach your front office about failed rolls of the dice, both in the draft and free agency. When they stink, it’s expected, and if they overachieve, it’s a lot of fun as a fan. That volatility is what I love– never knowing what you’ll get, who’s going to win you a game, who’s cooked and who still has something left. Even as a Celtics fan today (and I&amp;rsquo;m sure plenty would agree), you get nostalgic for the surprisingly-good rebuild seasons, especially when later teams that are supposed to be good underperform (as in become a bottom-10 defensive team and the worst 4th quarter team in the league). Knicks and Suns fans especially seem to be having those first fun years after a long rebuild, so be sure support them in their fun.&lt;/p&gt;
